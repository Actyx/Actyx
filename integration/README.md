# How to use this

Integration tests use primarily the artifacts built from the current commit, so you need to

- make ActyxOS and related binaries (`actyxos-linux` and `ax`) available by compiling them for all desired target platforms (will be taken from `Cosmos/dist/bin/*`), for instance `Cosmos/dist/bin/x64/actyxos-linux` and `Cosmos/dist/bin/x64/ax`
- change permission for the binaries `chmod +x actyxos-linux` and `chmod +x ax`
- run `npm run build` in `js/os-sdk` and `js/pond`

Then you can `npm i` and `npm test` in this project. If you forgot to first build the other JS projects, youâ€™ll have to remove `node_modules` and start over.

## Dev

| Scripts            | Description                                                       |
|--------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| npm test           | run all complete test suite                                       |
| npm run lint:fix   | automatically fix lint issues                                     |
| npm run clean:temp | remove the `temp` folder where test projects are cloned and built |

- To run only a single test file use for example: `npm run tsc && jest -- ./dist/src/ax/your-test.spec.js`

## Caveats

Currently on MacOS `actyxos-linux` binaries cannot be cross-compiled for linux (`cargo build --release --target x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu --bin actyxos-linux`). To get these files, instead open Azure Pipelines website, and go to your build. At the top, you will see "Related" and "XX published". Click on "XX published", open actyxos-bin-x64 -> x66, you'll find the `actyxos-linux` binary there. This will only happen with master builds or with PR builds that modify rt-master or build.
