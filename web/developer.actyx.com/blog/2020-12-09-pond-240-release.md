Today we are proud to announce the release of Pond version 2.4.0 [on npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@actyx/pond).

This release contains the following improvements:

- Improved [exception handling capabilities](/docs/how-to/actyx-pond/in-depth/exception-handling)
- `observeAll` – "Seed event" has succeeded "first event" terminologically. `expireAfterFirst` has been renamed to `expireAfterSeed`
- `observeAll` – The `makeFish` function is now allowed to return `undefined`, in order to ignore a given seed event
- Fixed an issue where moving a complex structure from an event into Fish state and later modifying that state could lead to data corruption
- Improved memory usage and time travel performance in some cases

On a related note, we have added [technical documentation for `observeAll`](/docs/how-to/actyx-pond/in-depth/observe-all) and [`observeOne`](/docs/how-to/actyx-pond/in-depth/observe-one).

Happy hacking!
