We are proud to release the 13th feature update of Actyx!
Since 2.0 we have continuously grown the feature set as well as the operational tooling (in particular in 2.10).
This update is significant because it introduces a well-rounded set of AQL features on the `query` endpoint.
These features should allow you to compute many dashboard-type outputs purely inside Actyx, without needing to implement aggregations in Typescript using fishes.
We also included the ability to run your query against a fixed dataset for testing and development, as demonstrated in the [new tutorial](/docs/tutorials/aql).
You can find all the details on this emerging query language in [the reference](/docs/reference/aql).

:::info feature flags needed
Please note that most of the features are now released as BETA features and require feature flags as shown in the tutorial and reference.

We are looking forward to hearing your thoughts and complaints on [the forum](https://community.actyx.com/) and one our [discord channel](https://discord.gg/nu5Gjfk4).
