Today we are proud to announce the release of Pond version 2.3.0 [on npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@actyx/pond).

This release contains the following improvements:

- Addition of `observeAll` and `observeOne` functions to the Pond – [see our dedicated blog post](/blog/2020/11/17/introducing-observe-all)
- `Pond.dispose()` will now properly shut down all async operations, so that applications may terminate orderly
- Fixed a bug where command serialization between subsequent calls to `Pond.run()` was broken if the argument Fish was originally woken by `Pond.observe()`
- Turn `Pond.test()` and `Pond.mock()` into synchronous functions
- Direct validation of arguments passed to `FishId.of()` – the strings must not be empty
- If the `enqueue` function passed to `pond.run()` callbacks is invoked after the callback has returned,
  it will now throw an error rather than silently fail to emit
- Support for nodejs 12 (LTS Erbium)

Happy hacking!
