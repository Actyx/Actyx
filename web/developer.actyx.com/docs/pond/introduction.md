Writing distributed apps is difficult. The **Actyx Pond** framework makes it simple.

The Actyx Pond is a highly opinionated framework for building always-available distributed apps on [ActyxOS](../os/introduction).
It provides a programming model and system guarantees ideally suitable for use-cases requiring 100% availability.
With this focus, the Actyx Pond can take care of concerns like eventual consistency, allowing you to concentrate on your business logic.
