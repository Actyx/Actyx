An Actyx solution always consists of several physical devices that each run an instance of Actyx. These devices are called [nodes](../../conceptual/actyx-jargon.mdx#node).
Your Actyx apps will be deployed on these nodes.
The example use case in this tutorial entails developing 3 apps:

## Order Management App

Runs on a mobile device and lets the user create and manage production orders.

## Dashboard App

Runs on a mobile device showing a dashboard displaying relevant production data.

## Wago Connector App

Runs on a machine gateway to start and finish production orders and collect machine data.

The below picture shows what the solution would look like in a production-scenario with three nodes.

import useBaseUrl from '@docusaurus/useBaseUrl'

<img src={useBaseUrl('images/tutorials/advanced-tutorial/advanced-tutorial-nodes.svg')} />

Don't worry in case you do not have Android phones, a machine gateway and a Wago PLC available. In this tutorial you will run all apps on only one Actyx node: your development machine.
The functionality is the same, no matter where your apps run.
In the last section of this tutorial, we will show you how to package these apps and explain how you could deploy them to actual devices.
