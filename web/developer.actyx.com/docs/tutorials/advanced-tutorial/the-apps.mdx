title: The apps

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';
import useBaseUrl from '@docusaurus/useBaseUrl';

In this section, you will explore the implementation of the apps. The first part will briefly explain the overall project structure, and the second and third section will focus on the fishes used by the apps as well as the apps themselves.

## Project structure

The project consists of a few configuration files, as well as 3 apps in the `src` folder: `dashboard`, `erp-simulator`, `wago-connector`. The `fish` folder contains all relevant fishes used in the apps.

## Business logic

Before diving into the code, have a look at the below illustration. It shows the events and states that will be modeled in the fishes and apps.

You will find the implementation of the event and state types, as well as the actual state machine, in the fishes. Event emission is triggered in the apps.

## Fishes

As discussed in more detail in the [Actyx Pond documentation](/docs/pond/introduction), a fish is the main programming unit in the Actyx Pond framework. It always represents one entity of your business logic and should always have only a single responsibility – which means in this case, you need fishes to keep track of your machines, as well as your orders.

```text
DemoMachineKit/src/fish/
├── index.ts
├── machineFish.ts
└── orderFish.ts
```

The `machineFish.ts` and `orderFish.ts` code is structured into the same sections:

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD036 -->

**1. Definition of state types**

**2. Definition of event types**

**3. Definition of tag types**

**4. Definition of fishes**

<!-- markdownlint-enable MD036 -->

For this use case, two kinds of fishes are defined for machines as well as orders. Each of the fishes serves a different purpose:

- implement state and logic of a single entity: A fish responsible for a single machine or order
- track and access many instances of an entity: A fish responsible for tracking all machines or all orders

In the following sections, we will take a closer look on how the fishes that track a single machine or order work.

### Machine fish

Open `machineFish.ts`. The following illustration should make it easier to understand `machineFish.ts`. It represents the state- and event types of the machine fish responsible for the state of a single machine:

<img src={useBaseUrl('images/tutorials/dx1-tutorial/machinefish.png')} />

### Order fish

Open `orderFish.ts`. The following illustration should make it easier to understand `orderFish.ts`. It represents the state- and event types of the order fish responsible for the state of a single order:

<img src={useBaseUrl('images/tutorials/dx1-tutorial/orderfish.png')} />

As you can see in `orderfish.ts` , `DefinedState` can be – depending on the event – either `idle`, `active`, or `done`.

## Apps

Now that you have seen the business logic shared by all apps in the fishes, this section gives a short overview of the three apps. Depending on whether the app will be packaged for the Webview Runtime (Dashboard and ERP-Simulator) or for the Docker Runtime (Wago-connector), the content of the app folder is slightly different. Each app directory is at least composed of:

- `ax-manifest.yml` describing the ActyxOS app
- `settings-schema.json` describing the settings schema of the app

In addition to the above, you will find files describing the logic itself.

If you want to know more about the ActyxOS-specific parts, please visit our [guide on building apps](/docs/os/guides/building-apps).

### ERP Simulator App

The ERP Simulator is a React app. Open `App.tsx` to inspect the business logic.

The order in this example is created through the UI and only contains information about the `duration`, `machine`, and `name`. In reality, this event would be generated by your ERP system (e.g. through an API) and have much more associated information – the underlying logic would be similar though.

### Dashboard App

Just as the ERP Simulator, the Dashboard is a React app. Open `Orders.tsx` and have a look at the logic of the ERP simulator app.

### Machine App

:::info
The PLC used for this example is a [Wago PLC](https://www.wago.com/global/automation-technology/discover-plcs).
:::

While this app is integrating with the above Wago PLC, the underlying logic is model-independent and would be similar for any other machine integration.
