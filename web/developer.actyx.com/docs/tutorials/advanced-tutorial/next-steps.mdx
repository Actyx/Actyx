At this point, you have run a simplified example of a solution based on three ActyxOS apps, and inspected the code of the apps. If you want to continue working with this example project, here are a few ideas:

- **Adapt the solution:** Introduce new data fields, e.g. `Customer`, for an order to be displayed on the dashboard

- **Develop another app:** Develop another web app that lets you start and finish orders through a UI instead of a machine connector

We would appreciate if you fill out the feedback form below, it should not take longer than 2 minutes. Thank you!
