title: Next steps

At this point, you have run a simplified example of a solution based on three ActyxOS apps, and inspected the code of the apps.

import useBaseUrl from '@docusaurus/useBaseUrl'

<img src={useBaseUrl('images/tutorials/advanced-tutorial/deployed-solution.gif')} />

If you want to continue working with this example project, here are a few ideas:

- **Deploy your apps**: Deploy the apk to an Android device and run the native electron app on a different machine to really experience local-first peer-to-peer communication
- **Amend the solution:** Introduce new data fields, e.g. `Customer`, for an order to be displayed on the dashboard
- **Create an additional app:** Implement a different react app that lets you start and finish orders through a UI instead of a machine connector

If you followed the tutorial and want to debug something, you can checkout the finished repository on the branch [**finished-tutorial**](https://github.com/Actyx/DemoMachineKit/tree/finished-tutorial).

We would appreciate if you fill out the feedback form below, it should not take longer than 2 minutes. Thank you!
