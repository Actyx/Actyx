title: Introduction
---

In this advanced example, you are going to learn advanced Actyx Pond programming concepts by exploring a simplified real-world production use case implemented on the Actyx platform.

This tutorial is divided into several sections:

- The **Solution architecture** section, outlines the different components of the installation
- The **Getting started** chapter explains how to run the apps locally
- The **Project** section explains how the project is structured
- The **Business logic** explains how the app logic is implemented using Actyx Pond
- The **Packaging** guide explains how you can package the apps for different platforms
- The **Next steps** chapter provides ideas on how to further work on and improve this example project

## The Use Case

We will cover a typical production use case in this tutorial.
In this imaginary, yet realistic factory setup there is a factory worker who is responsible for creating and managing production orders on a mobile device and a machine equipped with a [Wago PLC](https://www.wago.com/global/automation-technology/discover-plcs). Additionally, there is a monitor mounted on a stand next to the machine to display the production orders on a dashboard (see figure below).

## What you need

To understand this advanced Actyx tutorial, you should know the fundamentals of how to build an app using the Actyx Pond.
This tutorial builds on skills taught in the [chat app tutorial](../chat.mdx). Specifically, you should know how to do the following:

- How to install and start Actyx
- Write a local twin using the Actyx Pond programming framework

In addition, you will need:

- A good understanding of [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- A good understanding of [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- an hour or two for completing this tutorial

## What you'll learn

- How a real-world Actyx solution is implemented
- What the building blocks of an Actyx app are
- How to import order data into Actyx
- How to integrate with machines
- How to build dashboards and mobile apps with Actyx
- How to package apps for different platforms

## What you'll do

- Explore the implementation of three different apps
- Run these apps on your machine
- Import production order data into Actyx
- Integrate a machine PLC with Actyx
- Package the apps for mobile, desktop and Docker
