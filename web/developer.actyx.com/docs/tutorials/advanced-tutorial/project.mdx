title: The Project
---

In this section, you will explore each app and learn about their key characteristics. The first part will briefly explain the overall project structure, and the second section will focus on the apps themselves.

## Project structure

The project consists of a few configuration files, as well as 3 apps in the `src` folder: `dashboard`, `order-management`, `wago-connector`. The `fish` folder contains all relevant local twins used in the apps. For a more detailed explanation on how to set up an Actyx project, please check out our [dedicated guide](../../how-to/local-development/set-up-a-new-project.mdx) for this.

## Apps

### Order Management App

The Order Management is a React app. Open `App.tsx` to inspect the business logic.

The order in this example is created through the UI and only contains information about the `duration`, `machine`, and `name`. In reality, this event would be generated by your ERP system (e.g. through an API) and have much more associated information – the underlying logic would be similar though.

### Dashboard App

Just as the Order Management app, the Dashboard app is a React app. Open `Orders.tsx` or `Machines.tsx` and have a look at the logic of the Order Management app.

### Machine App

:::info
The PLC used for this example is a [Wago PLC](https://www.wago.com/global/automation-technology/discover-plcs).
:::

While this app is integrating with the above Wago PLC, the underlying logic is model-independent and would be similar for any other machine integration.
