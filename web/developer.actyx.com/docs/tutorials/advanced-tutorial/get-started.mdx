title: Get started
---

In this chapter, you will run all apps on your development machine and interact with them.
To do this, you need to download the sample project we have prepared for you. To get the sample project, you can either...

...clone the repository from GitHub by running

```text
git clone https://github.com/Actyx/DemoMachineKit.git
```

...or alternatively, you can download the repository as a `.zip` file, unzip it, and open it in the editor of your choice.

import { DownloadLink } from '../../../src/components/DownloadLink.tsx'

<DownloadLink cta="Download" link="https://github.com/Actyx/DemoMachineKit/archive/master.zip" />

## Run the apps

Before you can run the apps, make sure that Actyx is running, for a detailed installation guide, please refer to [this guide](../../how-to/local-development/install-actyx.mdx).

Before you start any apps, run `npm install` from the root directory.

To start the Dashboard app, run:

```text
npm run ui:dashboard:start
```

After visiting `localhost:1234` you should see an empty dashboard that only displays "Machines" and "Orders".

For creating orders, lets first start the Order Management App:

```text
npm run ui:order-management:start
```

In a different browser window, navigate to `localhost:1235`.
You should now be able to create an order and associate the following information with it:

- a name
- a planned duration
- a machine

After entering a name and selecting a duration, the `Place order` button will still be grayed out as your system does not know of a machine yet.

In order to let your system know of a new machine, start the Wago Connector App:

```text
npm run node:wago-connector:start
```

Since this app would normally run on a PLC mounted onto a machine, it does not have a user interface.
To check whether everything is working, check the output in your terminal or make sure that a new field with your machine `Wago Connector` appears in the **Order Management App**, allowing you to click on the button to place an order.

import useBaseUrl from '@docusaurus/useBaseUrl'

<img src={useBaseUrl('images/tutorials/advanced-tutorial/erp-ui.png')} />

After placing an order, take another look at the dashboard – you should now see newly created order:

<img src={useBaseUrl('images/tutorials/advanced-tutorial/dashboard-ui.png')} />

As the Wago Connector App running on your development machine is not connected to an actual Wago PLC, your machine will stay in the state `disabled`, and your order will stay in the state `idle`.
If your Wago Connector App was connected to an actual Wago PLC, it would show its state and your order would change into a different state (such as `running` or `interrupted`), depending on the data it receives from the Wago PLC.

To get a feel for what each app is doing, feel free to play around with them. For example create a few new orders, or stop the **Wago Connector App** and see how the system behaves.

Now that you have a basic understanding of the use case and how the apps work, we will take a closer look at the project structure and the apps in the next section.
