:::caution
This tutorial is a follow-up to the [introduction to event payloads](/docs/tutorials/getting-started/machine-runner/event-payloads),
as such, we recommend that you go through it first.
In the case you need the code from the previous tutorial, you can get from GitHub.
:::

In the previous tutorial we discussed event payloads,
in this one we will be discussing state payloads.

Once more, consider our imaginary company, where despite the funding helping the sensors,
we now need to track how much water we're using on the plant!

## Extending the states

To keep track of the spent water, we need to keep it through every state,
rather than a single one like we did for the event.

We can however use a single type for the payload:

```ts
type SpentWater = {
  /// Tracks the latest amount of water used
  lastMl: number
  /// Tracks the total amount of water used
  totalMl: number
}
```

As for the states, we will need to stop using `designEmpty` and use `designState` and `withPayload` instead:

```diff
- export const Idle = machine.designEmpty("Idle").finish()
- export const WateringPlant = machine.designEmpty("WateringPlant").finish()
+ export const Idle = machine
+   .designState("Idle")
+   .withPayload<SpentWater>()
+   .finish();
+ export const WateringPlant = machine
+   .designState("WateringPlant")
+   .withPayload<SpentWater>()
+   .finish();
```

Similarly to the previous tutorial, we broke a bunch of other places in the code.

Found 3 errors in the same file, starting at: src/robot.ts:41
```

</details>

To fix them, we need to correct the creation of states in our `react` calls.

### Fixing the errors

We'll start by fixing the `Idle.react` call:

```ts
Idle.react([Events.NeedsWater], WateringPlant, (state, event) => {
  console.log(`The plant is requesting ${event.payload.requiredWaterMl} ml of water!`)
  const newStatePayload = {
    lastMl: event.payload.requiredWaterMl,
    totalMl: state.self.totalMl + event.payload.requiredWaterMl,
  }
  return WateringPlant.make(newStatePayload)
})
```

We've replaced the `_` on our handler with `state`,
we are now returning `WateringPlant.make(newStatePayload)` instead of just `WateringPlant.make()`.

Our `newStatePayload` is also a mix between new properties and the old ones from the previous state,
we needed to replace the `lastMl` with the new amount from the event, and we needed to increase our spent water consumption
(and yes, we could do this in the transition from `WateringPlant` to `Idle` but didn't for the sake of simplicity).

Moving on to the transition from `WateringPlant` to `Idle`, we need a simpler change:

```ts
WateringPlant.react([Events.HasWater], Idle, (state, _) => Idle.make(state.self))
```

Notice that we're using the first argument of the handler, while for events we have previously used the second.
The first one is the `ReactionContext` which containts the current state payload (i.e. before the transition happens) under `self`.

We're not applying changes to the state since we've delegated all updates to the previous transition,
so in this case, we're just keeping the state as is.

The last error on our list is a bit more opaque:

```
src/robot.ts:55:50 - error TS2345: Argument of type 'StateFactory<"wateringRobot", "robot", Factory<"HasWater", Record<never, never>> | Factory<"NeedsWater", NeedsWaterPayload>, "Idle", SpentWater, Record<...>>' is not assignable to parameter of type 'StateFactory<"wateringRobot", "robot", Factory<"HasWater", Record<never, never>> | Factory<"NeedsWater", NeedsWaterPayload>, any, SpentWater | undefined, any>'.
  Types of property 'make' are incompatible.
    Type '(payload: SpentWater) => SpentWater' is not assignable to type '(payload: SpentWater | undefined) => SpentWater | undefined'.
      Types of parameters 'payload' and 'payload' are incompatible.
        Type 'SpentWater | undefined' is not assignable to type 'SpentWater'.
          Type 'undefined' is not assignable to type 'SpentWater'.

55   const machine = createMachineRunner(sdk, tags, Idle, undefined);
                                                    ~~~~
```

Notice how it points to `Idle` and it mentions:

> `(payload: SpentWater) => SpentWater` is not assignable to type `(payload: SpentWater | undefined) => SpentWater | undefined`

All this but our handlers return `SpentWater` not `SpentWater | undefined`, nor do they take the latter.
The fix is simpler than this, and astute readers may have detected the issue already.

It lies in the last parameter of `createMachineRunner` which is the payload for the initial state,
since we change the `Idle` payload to be `SpentWater` we can't pass it `undefined`.

To fix it, we simply need to pass an initial `SpentWater` payload to it:

```ts
const machine = createMachineRunner(sdk, tags, Idle, {
  lastMl: 0,
  totalMl: 0,
})
```

## Running our new robot!

Before we run our robot, let's add some logs to track our progress and request water more than once.

On `robot.ts`:

```diff
  Idle.react([Events.NeedsWater], WateringPlant, (state, event) => {
    console.log(
      `The plant is requesting ${event.payload.requiredWaterMl} ml of water!`
    )
    const newStatePayload = {
      lastMl: event.payload.requiredWaterMl,
      totalMl: state.self.totalMl + event.payload.requiredWaterMl,
    }
+   console.log(`Total water consumption: ${newStatePayload.totalMl}`)
    return WateringPlant.make(newStatePayload)
  })
```

And on `sensor.ts`:

```diff
async function main() {
  const sdk = await Actyx.of(manifest);
  const tags = protocol.tagWithEntityId("robot-1");

+   for (let i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
      await sdk.publish(
        tags.apply(
          Events.NeedsWater.make({
            requiredWaterMl: Math.floor(Math.random() * 100),
          })
        )
      );
      console.log("Published NeedsWater");

      await sdk.publish(tags.apply(Events.HasWater.make({})));
      console.log("Published HasWater");
+   }

  sdk.dispose();
}
```

Now we can run the robot and sensor like we have been doing.

## Conclusion

In this tutorial we have covered state payloads, how to create and use them.
This concludes the introductory tutorials about Machine Runner!
