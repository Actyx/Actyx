:::info
This tutorial is aimed at absolute begginers, picking up Actyx for their first time.
:::

Before we start, you should set up Actyx on your computer.
To do so, you should follow our [how-to guide to install and start Actyx](../../how-to/local-development/install-actyx)
as well as the guide to [install the CLI and Node Manager](../../how-to/local-development/install-cli-node-manager).

After you start Actyx, we can send your first event using the Actyx CLI (`ax`).

`ax` is your CLI companion to Actyx, allowing you to publish and query events,
inspect nodes, change settings and others.

:::note
To learn more about `ax` you can run `ax --help` or head over to the [Actyx CLI reference](../../reference/cli/overview).
:::

## Publishing an event

Using `ax` you can publish an event through the `events publish` interface,
if you look into its help text you will see the various options available:

```
USAGE:
    ax events publish [FLAGS] [OPTIONS] <NODE> <payload>

FLAGS:
    -h, --help       Prints help information
    -j, --json       Format output as JSON
    -V, --version    Prints version information
    -v

OPTIONS:
    -i, --identity <FILE>    File from which the identity (private key) for authentication is read
    -t, --tag <tag>...       tag (can be given multiple times)

ARGS:
    <NODE>       the IP address or <host>:<admin port> of the node to perform the operation on
    <payload>    event payload (JSON)
```

Given that we're just publishing to the local node, our `NODE` will be `localhost`
(`ax` assumes the default port for your convenience) and the
`payload` can be anything you want (as long at it is valid JSON).

Putting it all together, you should now be able to run the following command:

<Tabs>
<Windows>

```
.\ax events publish localhost "\"hello!\""
```

</Windows>

<Linux>

```
./ax events publish localhost "\"hello!\""
```

</Linux>

<Mac>

```
./ax events publish localhost "\"hello!\""
```

</Mac>
</Tabs>

Congratulations, you have published your first event ðŸŽ‰

But this isn't very exciting, how can we see it?
That leads to the [next tutorial](./first-query).
