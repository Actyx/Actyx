This tutorial immediately follows and uses the code of the [previous tutorial](./js-cooperative-task.mdx).
It is recommended to complete that before beginning this tutorial.

## The World Runs When You Do Your Part

In the [previous tutorial](./js-cooperative-task.mdx), we have visited the idea of two agents working on one sequential workflow,
and we have built a protocol which governs the communication between the agents on top of [`machine-runner`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@actyx/machine-runner) and `Actyx`.
Such a workflow completes only when all agents must complete their own task in time.
This tutorial will introduce a mean to prove that a `machine-runner`-based protocol fully facilitate all involved agents so that the overwall workflow completes using [`machine-check`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@actyx/machine-check).

Concretely, the previous tutorial illustrate the sequential workflow with a process of docking, drawing water, and undocking, involving one robot and one water pump.
In short the scenario is as follow:
1.) the pump signals that the dock is available;
2.) the robot docks, then signals the pump that it is ready for water;
3.) the pump draws water, and signals on completion;
4.) the robot leaves, then signals that it has sucessfully undocked and distanced.
`machine-runner`-based protocol provides interface in which, at a given state of the workflow,
the robot and the pump can give a crucial signal (i.e. emit events) to move the entire workflow forward.
