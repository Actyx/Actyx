This quickstart is intended for intermediate to advanced developers. It only gets you up and running with Actyx. For a gentler intro to Actyx, head to the [Chat Tutorial](chat.mdx).

_Before starting, make sure you have [git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed on your computer._

1. Install and start Actyx on your computer

import { Tabs } from '../../src/components'

<Tabs>
<Windows>

- Download [Actyx for Windows](https://developer.actyx.com/releases/actyx/latest)
- Double click and run through the installer
- Start Actyx via the Start Menu; a tray icon will appear

</Windows>
<Linux>

- Download Actyx for Linux ([64 bit](https://developer.actyx.com/releases/actyx/latest))
- Open a terminal, navigate to your downloads folder and run the following command `chmod +x actyx; ./actyx`

</Linux>
<Mac>

- Download [Actyx for Mac](https://developer.actyx.com/releases/actyx/latest)
- Open a terminal and run the following command `cd ~/Downloads; chmod +x actyx-mac; ./actyx-mac`

:::tip
If you do not get asked for your password, you have to explicitly allow Actyx:

1. Go to **Settings** and then to **Security &amp; Privacy**. In the **General** tab, you should see a prompt at the bottom that asks you to allow Actyx CLI.
2. When running the first `ax` command, you will be prompted again to allow the Actyx CLI.

</Mac>
</Tabs>

2. Now download and set up the quickstart project by running `npm init actyx quickstart`

```shell
$ npm init actyx quickstart
✔ Loaded starter project
✔ Installed dependencies
Type 'cd quickstart && npm run start' to run
```

3. Once the set up is done, navigate into the `quickstart` directory and run it with `npm run start`

```shell
$ cd quickstart
$ npm run start

> actyx-quickstart@1.0.0 start
> ts-node index

Hello, World!
Hello 1!
Hello 2!
```

If you see messages starting with "Hello" pop up, everything is working! Press Ctrl+C to shutdown the process.

:::caution Error `ECONNREFUSED 127.0.0.1:4454`
If you get this error please double-check that Actyx is actually running on your computer.

4. Now you are ready to start programming on Actyx

Try editing the code in the `index.ts` file. Then save your changes and restart the node process.
