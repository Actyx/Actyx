:::info This guide assumes Actyx is installed in the local development environment

If Actyx is not yet installed, [follow this instruction](/docs/how-to/local-development/install-actyx).

Actyx functions primarily to [stream and store events](/docs/conceptual/event-streams), which the application can use to publish events, query events, and subscribe to event streams.
This guide will explain the various methods to publish events using Actyx SDK, Actyx CLI.

## Using Actyx SDK (JS/TS)

:::info JS/TS knowledge

Follow Actyx SDK installation [instruction here](/docs/how-to/local-development/install-js-libs). The audience is assumed to be familiar with the development of application based on `JS/TS`, `NodeJS`, and `npm`.

:::

With Actyx SDK installed, import all required objects.
Before using Actyx SDK, prepare a [manifest](/docs/how-to/app-auth/authenticate-with-app-manifest).
Then, authenticate the manifest using the `Actyx.of` function.

```typescript
import { Actyx, Tag } from "@actyx/sdk";

const MANIFEST = {
  "appId": "com.example.app",
  "displayName": "Example App",
  "version": "1.0"
};

const main = async () => {
  const actyx = await Actyx.of(MANIFEST);
  
  // ... tag values
  // ... publish events
};
```

The method returns a promise that resolves into an `Actyx` object.
The object expose Actyx APIs, one of it is `.publish` which we will use for this guide.

The next step is to prepare an event that will be published, which needs to be [tagged](/docs/conceptual/tags).
For now, as an example, a value `{ someProperty: "someValue" }` is tagged with 2 tags, "sometag".

```typescript
const main = async () => {
  // connect to actyx ...

  const tag = Tag("sometag").and(Tag("sometag2)); // apply 2 tags to the event
  const data = { someProperty: "someValue" }; // data can be of arbitrary type
  const taggedData = tag.apply(data);

  // ... publish events
}
```

Finally, publish the tagged value using `.publish` method.

```typescript
const main = async () => {
  // connect to actyx ...
  // tag values ...

  await actyx.publish(taggedData)
}
```

The method returns a promise that will be resolved once Actyx finished storing the events.

};

const main = async () => {
  // connect to actyx
  const actyx = await Actyx.of(MANIFEST);
  // tag values ...
  const tag = Tag("sometag").and(Tag("sometag2)); // apply 2 tags to the event
  const data = { someProperty: "someValue" }; // data can be of arbitrary type
  const taggedData = tag.apply(data);
  // publish events
  await actyx.publish(taggedData)
}
```

## Using Actyx CLI

:::info Actyx CLI is assumed to have been installed correctly

If that is not the case, follow the [instruction on this link](/docs/how-to/local-development/install-cli-node-manager#actyx-cli).

:::

Here is the command used to publish events:

```bash
USAGE:
    ax events publish [FLAGS] [OPTIONS] <NODE> <payload>

FLAGS:
    -h, --help       Prints help information
    -j, --json       Format output as JSON
    -V, --version    Prints version information
    -v               

OPTIONS:
    -i, --identity <FILE>    File from which the identity (private key) for authentication is read
    -t, --tag <tag>...       tag (can be given multiple times)

ARGS:
    <NODE>       the IP address or <host>:<admin port> of the node to perform the operation on
    <payload>    event payload (JSON)
```

Assuming Actyx Node is running on `localhost`,
to publish an event where the payload is `{ "someProperty": "someValue" }`,
tagged with `sometag` and `sometag2`,
run the following command:

```bash
$ ax events publish localhost "{\"someProperty\":\"someValue\"}" --tag "sometag" "sometag2"
```
