With Actyx 2.0, the format of the app manifest changes, as well as the way you provide it to Actyx. Let's use the following v1-compatible app manifest as an example for this migration guide:

```json
{
    "manifestVersion": "1.0",
    "type": "web",
    "id": "com.actyx.dashboard",
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "displayName": "Machine dashboard",
    "description": "This app displays a machine dashboard.",
    "dist": "release",
    "main": "release/index.html",
    "settingsSchema": "./settings-schema.json"
}
```

The new manifest only requires an app ID, version, and display name.
Making the above example v2-compatible looks as follows:

```json
{
    "appId": "com.actyx.dashboard",
    "displayName": "Machine dashboard",
    "version": "1.0.0"
}
```

Now that you have a new manifest, you need to do 2 more things:

1. Sign the app manifest. Please follow the steps in the [how-to guide for signing app manifests](../app-auth/sign-app-manifest).
2. Instead of packaging the manifest together with the app, you now provide it to Actyx via the SDK or Pond. Please follow the steps in the [how-to guide on authenticating with an app manifest](../app-auth/authenticate-with-app-manifest).

After migrating your app manifest, you can start to migrate your app [packaging, logging and settings](./migrate-app-logs-and-settings).
