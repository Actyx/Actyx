This guide is about packaging, logging, and settings management as the tooling you can use for logging and settings management is dependent on how you package your app.

Actyx does not provide app runtimes anymore.
This means your apps run natively on the host and you can use any 3rd party tools for packaging, logging, as well as settings management.
These tools offer you a lot more functionality than Actyx runtimes did, you can check a few of our recommendations out in our how-to guides:

- [Package mobile apps](../packaging/mobile-apps.mdx)
- [Package desktop apps](../packaging/desktop-apps.mdx)
- [Package headless apps](../packaging/headless-apps.mdx)

While these how-to guides only refer to packaging, the tools mentioned in them also provide documentation for implementing logging and settings management.
