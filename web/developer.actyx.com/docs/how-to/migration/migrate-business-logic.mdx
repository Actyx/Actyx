Most of your apps' business logic will work almost out-of-the-box.
Depending on how your app was built, you need to do the following:

1. Upgrade Actyx Pond
2. Upgrade Actyx SDK (TypeScript)
3. Ensure compatibility with an event log that identifies event streams by `semantics`

### Actyx Pond

Upgrade `@actyx/pond` to version 3. 
If you were using version 2, the business logic you wrote will still work.

### Actyx SDK

Replace `@actyx/os-sdk` with `@actyx/sdk`.
As the `@actyx/os-sdk` was using the Events API v1 (based on `semantics` and `name`), this entails updating to the tag-based Events API v2 that was already used in the Actyx Pond v2.

### Ensure compatibility with an old event log

This step is only required if your apps need to be compatible with "old" data, i.e. events that were created directly through the Events HTTP API, or through the `@actyx/os-sdk`.
To be compatible with these events, you can use the following tags:

- `semantics:*`
- `fish_name:*`
