If your apps used any externally stored offset maps (for e.g. exporting data into other systems), you need to migrate them as well.
All events have been rewrittem by your new v2 nodes, so you now need to replace the source ID in the offset map with the corresping ID of the stream in which the events of a source have been rewritten.

:::info Why replace source ID with stream ID?
In Actyx v1, there was only one event stream per node so the source ID served as an identifier for your node as well as its event stream.
Therefore, you could identify events in a stream by source ID and offset.
In Actyx v2, a node can have multiple streams. 
In order to identify an event, you now need a stream ID and offset.

For more information, please check out [our guide on event streams](../../conceptual/event-streams.mdx).
:::

After successful migration, each node published an event containing the old source ID and new stream ID.
