This guide explains how to migrate bootstrap nodes.
Please note that this guide is only relevant to you if you used a dedicated bootstrap node that was not running apps and emitting events.

If you used a "normal" node as a bootstrap node, you can directly continue to the next [guide on migrating production nodes](./migrate-production-nodes.mdx) as you need to migrate it the same way as all other nodes.

Actyx v2 does not offer a dedicated image for nodes that facilitate discovery–previously called *bootstrap nodes*–anymore.
Instead, you can just use a normal node and deploy it as a so-called *discovery helper node* in v2 production deployments.
In order to migrate your bootstrap node, follow these steps:

1. Stop your bootstrap node
2. Deploy a discovery helper node as described in [this guide](../operations/discovery-helper-node.mdx)

Now that your discovery helper node is running, you can start to [migrate your production nodes](./migrate-production-nodes.mdx).
Please bear in mind that you need to remove the address of the _old bootstrap node_ from your nodes' settings.
