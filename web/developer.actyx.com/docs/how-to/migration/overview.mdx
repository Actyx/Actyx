This series of guides is for everyone who has developed an app and/or is running a deployment on Actyx v1.
While it looks like a lot has changed, most of what you know and like about Actyx is still the same; we wanted to be as thorough as possible and provide detailed explanations and examples for the migration procedure.

## Notable new features

Although you will probably not notice most of the internal changes, Actyx v2 is built differently from the ground up.
It sets the foundation for building groundbreaking new features (such as ephemeral events or partial replication) in the future.
Some of the new features to keep an eye on in Actyx 2.0.0 include:

- Production support for Windows, Linux and macOS (they were in beta before)
- Significant performance improvements
- Ephemeral events

Check out our [blog post](https://developer.actyx.com/blog) for more information on the release, and on the features that are planned for the next v2 releases.

## Breaking changes

This section contains a list of breaking changes from 1.x:

### APIs

- [Events API](../../reference/events-api) now uses tags (instead of `semantics` and  `name`) to align it with the Pond, and requires apps to authenticate.
- [Auth API](../../reference/auth-api) for receiving authentication tokens to interact with the Events API.

### Communication between Actyx and CLI

- Communication between Actyx and CLI is secured; [users need a keypair for authentication and be authorized to manage a node](../auth/set-up-user-keys).

### Actyx internals

- Network protocols and data storage formats have changed. While this does not impact you directly, it is relevant to how the [migration described below works](#migrating-your-production-deployment).

### App packaging, logging, and settings

- Actyx does not provide app runtimes anymore. This means your apps run natively on the host and you can use any 3rd party tools for packaging, logging, as well as settings management. 

### Migrating your apps

There is the recommended approach for migrating your apps to work with Actyx v2:

- [Migrate business logic](./migrate-business-logic)
- [Migrate your Actyx app manifest](./migrate-app-manifest)
- [Migrate your app packaging, logs and settings](./migrate-app-logs-and-settings)

### Migrating your production deployment

:::info Migrating your production deployment to v2?
If you want to migrate your production deployment to v2, we strongly recommend waiting for version 2.1.
It will contain dedicated functionality to enable a smooth migration.
However, it still makes sense to already start migrating your apps.
If you have any questions, please [get in touch with us and the Actyx community](https://community.actyx.com/), or contact us directly.
