Actyx Node Manager and the Actyx Command Line Interface (CLI) are tools to manage your Actyx nodes and apps.
While the Node Manager is an application that allows you to interact with the nodes in an easy-to-use user interface,
with the CLI you can interact with your Actyx environment by running commands in your favorite terminal program:

- Unix based operating systems: Use common shell programs such as bash, zsh or tcsh to run commands in linux shells
- Windows: On Windows, run commands with the Windows command prompt or in PowerShell

Please choose your development platform in the tabs below and follow the instructions.
