In this guide, you will learn what things to consider when creating and setting up your first project with Actyx.
However, please note that these are only best-practice recommendations that we think are the best way to do this.
You can, of course, do it any way you like.

So let's start by creating a folder for our project which will contain the code for the entire project.

For the purpose of this guide, we will choose the — very creative — name **ExampleProject**.
You can do this on your command line using the following commands:

```text
mkdir ExampleProject
cd ExampleProject
```

With projects on the Actyx platform, it is important to think about a holistic solution rather than a single isolated app.
This has to do with the decentralized and event-based nature of Actyx.
When digitizing factory processes directly on the shop floor, there are many players involved:
Workers may have an application on tablets that show them configuration parameters for machines on a production line, while headless connector apps running on edge gateways collect data directly from machines and distribute it throughout the entire shop floor.
Additionally, some dashboards apps running on industry PCs display critical production KPIs on dashboards for factory workers and managers to see.
The important thing is that **all of these entities rely on the same information** and thus **the same events**.

The way events are emitted, queried and subscribed to with Actyx works by using our programming framework Actyx Pond.
This framework provides the tools for you to create so-called `Fishes`.
And since these fishes are responsible for creating the event streams flowing between each entity on the shop floor, we recommend having all of them in one place.
So let's go ahead and create a dedicated folder for them called **fishes**.

Now, as stated earlier, many different apps can be part of your project.
And since each app will have different dependencies and needs, it makes sense to separate them.
Taking the above example, let's now create one folder for each app.
In the end, your project structure could now look something like this:

```text
ExampleProject/
├── img/
├── src/
│   ├── dashboard-app/
│   ├── machine-connector-app/
│   ├── worker-tablet-app/
│   └── fishes/
└── README.md
```

Since the Actyx tools you are going to use are JS/TS-based, the app folders will contain files typical for JS/TS-based projects, such as

- `package.json`
- `package-lock.json`
- `tsconfig.json`

However, since there are various ways to set up a Javascript project, the contents of the individual app folders may vary, depending on the application.
