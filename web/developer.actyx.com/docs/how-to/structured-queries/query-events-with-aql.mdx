The Actyx Query Language (AQL) allows you to query, filter, transform, and aggregate events in a structured fashion.
For a quickstart please refer to [the tutorial](../../tutorials/aql.mdx) whereas all details are documented in [the reference](../../reference/aql.mdx).
In this section we take a look at how Actyx helps you access exactly those events you need and why that is important.
As we will see, this has implications on how events should be tagged when they are emitted; best practices for this are discussed in the next section.

## AQL evaluation explained

When you send a query to one of the [API endpoints](../../reference/events-api.mdx) Actyx will — after a syntax check — do two things:
first it will instruct the local event store to retrieve all events matching the `FROM` clause, and second it will create an evaluation engine for the following query steps.
Then, matching events will be streamed into that engine, always completing all steps before continuing with the next event.
Whenever an output emerges from the last query step it is serialised to JSON and sent to your app.

Assuming you model some entities — like TODO items — with a lifecycle we might store events for creating, editing, progress tracking, and completing them.
If you want to get the IDs of all items created within the past month you might do the following:

```sql
FROM 'item' & TIME > 1M ago -- get all item events
FILTER _.type = 'created'   -- skip all but creations
SELECT _.id                 -- pick out the ID
```

Assuming a couple of edits and lots of progress tracking it may well be that the filter step throws away >90% of the work done by the local event store for streaming the events.
This can be avoided by tagging the creation events with an additional tag, so that we can write:

```sql
FROM 'item' & 'created' & TIME > 1M ago
SELECT _.id
```

The performance difference between these can be quite noticeable.
This is doubly relevant when the query isn’t crafted by you but sent indirectly, e.g. via the Actyx Pond library:
in this case the filtering would need to be done inside your `onEvent` function in TypeScript, which wastes not only the work inside the Actyx event store but also the much more costly serialisation and deserialisation of the events on their path towards `onEvent`.

:::info take notice!
Excessive event retrieval is the #1 performance sin in Actyx, comparable to full table scans in relational databases.
Event tagging fulfils the same function as indexing in those databases.

## Queries sent from TypeScript apps

When you’re using the [Actyx Pond](../../conceptual/pond.mdx) you are using AQL queries under the hood:
a [fish](https://developer.actyx.com/docs/reference/pond/modules#fish)’s `where` property directly corresponds to a query with only a `FROM` clause.
The same goes for the SDK methods like [`Actyx.queryAllKnown`](../../reference/pond/interfaces/EventFns#queryallknown), which take a [`Where`](../../reference/pond/interfaces/Where) instance to select events.

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```ts
const itemTag = Tag<ItemEvent>('item') // entity type tag for “Items”
const createdTag = Tag('created')      // additional tag, can be attached elsewhere

itemTag                 // corresponds to `FROM 'item'`
itemTag.withId('1234')  // corresponds to `FROM 'item' & 'item:1234'`
itemTag.and(createdTag) // corresponds to `FROM 'item' & 'created'`

const item1 = itemTag.withId('1')
const item2 = itemTag.withId('2')
item1.or(item2) // corresponds to `FROM 'item' & 'item:1' | 'item' & 'item:2'`
                // which is the same as `FROM 'item' & ('item:1' | 'item:2')`

const userTag = Tag<UserEvent>('user')
const myItem = itemTag.id('1234')  // note that `.id()` omits the 'item' tag and doesn’t
                                   // require matching events to be of type `ItemEvent`
userTag.withId('Fred').and(myItem) // => `FROM 'user' & 'user:Fred' & 'item:1234'`
```

Note the different roles of tags:

- `'item'` marks events emitted by an “item” entity and constrains the event type
- `'item:1234'` is an additional tag that marks one particular “item” entity; it can be created with `itemTag.id('1234')` and does not by itself constrain the event type
- `'created'` marks the occasion and could be combined with items, users, etc.

Note that the `createdTag` could be declared as `Tag<{ id: string }>('created')` to constrain its application to events that do have an `id` property of type `string`.
The `Where` interface correctly tracks these constraints through `.and()` and `.or()` combinations of tags.
