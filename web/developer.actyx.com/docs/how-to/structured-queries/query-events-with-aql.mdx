The Actyx Query Language (AQL) allows you to query, filter, transform, and soon aggregate events in a structured fashion.

## Features

AQL currently has the following features:

- **Query** events by source, tags, app ID, timestamp, event key
- **Filter** by event payload to discard events
- **Select** event payload contents
- **Transform** event payloads using arithmetic operations and case expressions

Currently, AQL queries (or subscriptions) always return events. The ability to aggregate (e.g. SUM) events is being worked on.

## Run AQL queries

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs'
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem'

You can run AQL queries using the CLI, the Node Manager or any of the SDKs.
Here are examples how to use AQL in each one:

<Tabs
  groupId="method"
  defaultValue={"cli"}
  values={[
    { label: 'CLI', value: 'cli' },
    { label: 'Node Manager', value: 'node-manager' },
    { label: 'Typescript SDK', value: 'ts-sdk' },
    { label: 'C#/.NET SDK', value: 'csharp-sdk' },
    { label: 'Rust SDK', value: 'rust-sdk' },
  ]}
>

<TabItem value="cli">

Use the Actyx CLI's `events query` subcommand to run AQL queries:

```bash
ax events query localhost "FROM 'discovery'"
```

This will return a list of JSON objects which are either events or errors/warnings if the query is invalid or cannot be executed.

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="node-manager">

The _Query_ screen in the Node Manager allows you to perform AQL queries:

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="ts-sdk">

Install the Typescript/Javascript SDK using `npm install @actyx/sdk` and then run AQL queries as follows:

```ts
import { Actyx } from '@actyx/sdk'

;(async () => {
  // Connect to the local Actyx process
  const actyx = await Actyx.of({
    appId: 'com.example.app',
    displayName: 'Example App',
    version: '1.0.0',
  })

  // Run AQL query
  const results = await actyx.queryAql("FROM 'discovery'")

  // Do something with the results
  results.forEach((result) => {
    if (result.type === 'event') {
      console.log(JSON.stringify(result.payload))
    }
  })
})()
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="rust-sdk">Rust SDK</TabItem>

</Tabs>

## Query events by time

:::info Beta features
If a query begins with `FEATURES()` it uses beta functionality. Please refer to the [AQL reference guide](../../reference/aql.mdx) for a detailed specification of AQL and its features.
:::

You can query events by their timestamp. This is an example of a query for events between 14:09 and 14:11 on 06 August 2021:

```text
FEATURES(timeRange)
FROM from(2021-08-06T14:09:00Z) & to(2021-08-06T14:11:00Z)
```

## Query events by tags

In addition to a specific time, you could also add a query for specific tags:

```text
FEATURES(timeRange)
FROM from(2021-08-06T14:09:00Z) & to(2021-08-06T14:11:00Z)
& 'machine2512'
```

:::info Usage of tags
When published, each event can be tagged with an arbitrary number of tags. Check out [conceptual guide on tags](../../conceptual/tags.mdx) or our [how-to guides for business logic](../actyx-pond/introduction.mdx) for more info.
:::

:::info Tags with IDs
By convention, events corresponding to a specific instance of a domain entity are tagged with `<entity>:<id>`.
When using [Actyx Pond](../../how-to/actyx-pond/introduction.mdx), you will have come across [the `Tag.withId()` helper](../../how-to/actyx-pond/guides/typed-tags.mdx).
It uses this convention as well.
So, e.g., you'd use `FROM 'machine:42'` to select events that have been tagged with `Tag<MachineEvent>('machine').withId(42)`.
:::

## Query events by app ID

You could add also use a query such as the following to get the events for a specific appId and tag:

```text
FROM 'machine2512' & appId(com.actyx.example)
```

## Transform data

With AQL, you can write down the transformation from events into query results in an incremental fashion, doing one step at a time.

For the following example, we assume that our event payload is structured as follows:

```json
{
    "byUser": {
        "name": "<string>",
        "id": "<string>"
    },
    "type": "<string>",
    ...
}
```

### Filter events

If one of the above examples was not be specific enough, you can also filter out certain results:

```
FEATURES(timeRange)
FROM from(2021-08-06T14:09:00Z) & to(2021-08-06T14:11:00Z)
FILTER _.type = "Started"
```

The above query only returns events that have a property "type" with value "Started".

### Transform events

For the returned events, you can also modify the format of the payload:

```
FEATURES(timeRange)
FROM from(2021-08-06T14:09:00Z) & to(2021-08-06T14:11:00Z)
FILTER _.type = "Started"
SELECT _["byUser"].name    <--- As the property is camelCase, you have to use a specific syntax
```

The above query only returns the value of the property "name" within the property "byUser".
