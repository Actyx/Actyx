This guide is part of a series about running your own Actyx deployment in production.
If you haven't done so, we strongly encourage you to read the [previous guide](./sign-app-manifest)!

If you're still testing Actyx or developing your application, set the node licensing
to `development` in the node settings.

```json
"licensing": {
    "node": "development"
}
```

:::

In order for your app to access the Events API, it needs to be authenticated with the node it is running on.
This how-to guide explains the steps you need to take to authenticate your app with a node.
You can authenticate your app using our Typescript SDK (recommended) or by manually using the [Auth API](../../reference/auth-api.mdx).
For this guide, let's use the following `my-manifest.json` as an example:

```json title="my-manifest.json"
{
  "appId": "com.actyx.example",
  "displayName": "Example App",
  "version": "2.0",
  "signature": "v2tzaWdfdmVyc2lvbgBtZGV2X3NpZ25hdHVyZXhYMTdNQkpYTGVhM3VzTC94RFQ1dWM3bW53c2pyWnhNdGVZeUxSWUdCQzh6VitFTm1tQ0ZkQjRCOCtSeTNQSDNHN2haNEt0NE80eXpMSEdFT3J5blpVQ3c9PWlkZXZQdWJrZXl4LTA0T2dDSkFYSFU5bnRjbkpnaXl2NnFJbmtYUGg0MG5DcFJiS0tJcXVuckJNPWphcHBEb21haW5zgWtjb20uYWN0eXguKmtheFNpZ25hdHVyZXhYUWwyaU5MQjRmbHlCYWFhWHhMRUF0RzZhbzlUWlpJTVFVaDlSL2poNXNzVVRQNHR5d3RRcjIvZitXR2FWSHdlQ0xhVnVDY3JDOWdTVE0zSnRqZFA4QWc9Pf8="
}
```

:::info
App IDs must be lowercase and written in reverse domain name notation (and valid as DNS names, i.e. consist of ASCII letters, digits, and dashes).

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs'

<Tabs
  groupId="tool"
  defaultValue={"sdk"}
  values={[
    { label: "JS/TS SDK", value: "sdk" },
    { label: "HTTP API", value: "http" }
  ]}

<TabItem value="sdk">

The SDK automatically manages the authentication flow for the application.
It only needs to be provided with the signed manifest upon initialization.
It then does two things automatically:

- Upon initialization, it gets a token from the Auth API or fails with an error.
- It deals with expired token responses, and will automatically try to get a new token from the Auth API. If the token is not renewed, it fails with an error.

See an example below of how to initialize the SDK with the signed manifest.

```ts
import { Actyx } from '@actyx/sdk'
const manifest = require('my-manifest.json')

try {
  // pass in manifest as first argument
  // second argument is optional
  const actyx = await Actyx.of(manifest, connectionOpts)
} catch (error) {
  console.error(error)
}
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="http">

See an example of how to request a new auth token with every HTTP request to the Events API:

```text title="Example Usage"
curl \
    -s -X "GET" \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer $(curl -s localhost:4454/api/v2/authenticate -d'{"appId": "com.actyx.example","displayName": "Actyx Example App","version": "2.0", "signature": "AX45KJT4FEGERH2B34RL324TJ4H2536452BRFVJHDFBVLSDVWJHB444="}' -H "Content-Type: application/json" | jq -r '.token')" \
    -H "Accept: application/json" \
    http://localhost:4454/api/v2/events/offsets | jq .
```

:::warning
It is highly recommended to use the JS/TS SDK for app authentication.
If you are manually using the Auth HTTP API, please note that you need to implement the necessary error handling and behavior that checks for an expired or invalid auth token.
