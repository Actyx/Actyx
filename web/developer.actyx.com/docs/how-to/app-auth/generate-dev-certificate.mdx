This guide is part of a series about running your own Actyx deployment in production.
If you haven't done so, we strongly encourage you to read the [previous guide](./compiling-actyx)!

If you're still testing Actyx or developing your application, set the node licensing
to `development` in the node settings.

```json
"licensing": {
    "node": "development"
}
```

## Generate your developer certificate

The developer certificate allows you to [sign app manifests](sign-app-manifest).
It is linked to the domain name of the email address on the application manifest,
thus, you can only use it to sign app manifests with an app ID that matches your
reverse domain name.

For example, if your email address is `developer@actyx.com`, you could use the
certificate for signing app manifests with app IDs starting with `com.actyx.`.

Using `ax-cert`, create the developer certificate.

If you created a developer key pair (should be different than the Actyx one):

```
cargo run --bin ax-cert dev-cert \
    --actyx-private-key "$(base64 -i <path_to_your_actyx_private_key>)" \
    --dev-private-key "$(base64 -i <path_to_your_dev_private_key>)" \
    --app-domains "com.actyx.*" "com.example.*"

{
  "devPrivkey":"08lUw93C+xzdxBcsYOoPVjzn8IHPJtnJW9Y/WyEu4v64=",
  "devPubkey":"0nz1YdHu/JDmS6CImcZgOj9Y960sJOPrbZHAJO107qW0=",
  "appDomains":["com.actyx.*","com.example.*"],
  "axSignature":"8Bl3zCNno5GbpKUoati7CiFgr0KGwNHB1kTwBVKzO9pzW07hFkkQ+GXvyc9QaWhHT5aXzzO+mVrx3eiC7TREAQ=="
}
```

If you did not create a developer private key, `ax-cert` will to create one for you:

```
$ cargo run --bin ax-cert dev-cert \
    --actyx-private-key "$(base64 -i <path_to_your_actyx_private_key>)" \
    --app-domains "com.actyx.*" "com.example.*"

{
  "devPrivkey":"08lUw93C+xzdxBcsYOoPVjzn8IHPJtnJW9Y/WyEu4v64=",
  "devPubkey":"0nz1YdHu/JDmS6CImcZgOj9Y960sJOPrbZHAJO107qW0=",
  "appDomains":["com.actyx.*","com.example.*"],
  "axSignature":"8Bl3zCNno5GbpKUoati7CiFgr0KGwNHB1kTwBVKzO9pzW07hFkkQ+GXvyc9QaWhHT5aXzzO+mVrx3eiC7TREAQ=="
}
```

You can also use the `ACTYX_PRIVATE_KEY` environment variable instead of setting `--actyx-private-key`.
