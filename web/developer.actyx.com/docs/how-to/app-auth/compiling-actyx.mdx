# Compiling your own Actyx

This guide is the starting point to deploying your own Actyx swarm to production.
We start by showing you how to compile Actyx enabling you to fully control which
applications run on your swarm.

Actyx releases are embedded with a public key to ensure that applications running on an
official release are certified by Actyx.
When rolling your own Actyx deployment, you will want to set this value to your public key.

:::info Example keys

While this guide also addresses generating the required keys, we provide example ones
(base64 encoded) for the sake of consistent outputs.

|         | Actyx                                           | Developer                                       |
| ------- | ----------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Public  | `075i62XGQJuXjv6nnLQyJzECZhF29acYvYeEOJ3kc5M8=` | `0nz1YdHu/JDmS6CImcZgOj9Y960sJOPrbZHAJO107qW0=` |
| Private | `0WBFFicIHbivRZXAlO7tPs7rCX6s7u2OIMJ2mx9nwg0w=` | `08lUw93C+xzdxBcsYOoPVjzn8IHPJtnJW9Y/WyEu4v64=` |

:::

To do so, you first need to generate an Ed25519 key pair, in case you do not know how to do so
you can refer to [GitHub's tutorial](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent#generating-a-new-ssh-key) on the topic.

After you have your key pair, we need to download Actyx and compile it using your key.

1. Start by cloning the repository.

```bash
git clone git@github.com:Actyx/Actyx.git
```

2. Navigate to `rust/actyx`.

```bash
cd rust/actyx
```

3. Compile Actyx, using your public key.

:::caution Don't forget the dependencies!

<details>
<summary>Actyx depends on `protoc` and compilation will fail if it isn't installed on your system. Open to learn how to install it on your system.</summary>

<Tabs>
<Windows>

Using Chocolatey:

```powershell
choco install protoc
```

</Windows>
<Mac>

Using brew:

```bash
brew install protobuf
```

</Mac>
<Linux>

Using `apt`:

```bash
apt-get install protobuf-compiler
```

</Linux>
</Tabs>

</details>

:::

```bash
export AX_PUBLIC_KEY="$(base64 -i <path_to_your_public_key>)"
cargo build --bin actyx --release --locked
```

4. (Optional) Double check that your public key in fact embedded in the Actyx binary:

```bash
strings target/release/actyx | grep $AX_PUBLIC_KEY
```
