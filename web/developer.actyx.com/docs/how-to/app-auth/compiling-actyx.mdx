# Compiling your own Actyx

:::tip
This guide is the starting point to deploying your own Actyx swarm to production.
We start by showing you how to compile Actyx enabling you to fully control which
applications run on your swarm.

If you're still testing Actyx or developing your application, set the node licensing
to `development` in the node settings.

```json
"licensing": {
    "node": "development"
}
```

:::

When running Actyx in production, you have fine grained control over which applications
are authorized to run on which node, along with it, you can also sign applications to
ensure the authenticity of the running application.

To enable this, Actyx makes use of assymetric cryptography, more precisely
[Ed25519](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EdDSA#Ed25519) keys.
When running your own Actyx deployment, you will need to generate these key pairs and
compile Actyx from source.

:::info Download Actyx's source

To simplify the rest of the tutorial, ensure you have downloaded Actyx's source code:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:Actyx/Actyx.git
```

:::

## Generate your own Actyx key pair

As discussed, to roll your own Actyx deployment, you will need to generate your own key pair,
so, without further ado, let's start.

:::tip
In upcoming tutorials, a "developer key pair" will be mentioned, the generation process
for said key is the same as for the Actyx key (i.e. you can come back and read this section).
:::

1. Navigate to `rust/actyx`.

```bash
cd rust/actyx
```

2. Using the Actyx CLI (`ax`), generate your Actyx key pair. It will ask you where to
   store the key pair, you can use the provided directory or select your own, in either
   case, just make sure you do not lose the key pair (you will need it).

```bash
cargo run --bin ax users keygen
Generating public/private key pair ..
Enter path in which to save the key (/Users/jmgd/Library/Application Support/actyx/keys/users/id):
Your private key has been saved at /Users/jmgd/Library/Application Support/actyx/keys/users/id
Your public key has been saved at /Users/jmgd/Library/Application Support/actyx/keys/users/id.pub
```

:::tip Example keys

If you are just trying out the process and do not want to generate a key pair, you can
use the following _example_ keys.

|         | Actyx                                           | Developer                                       |
| ------- | ----------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Public  | `075i62XGQJuXjv6nnLQyJzECZhF29acYvYeEOJ3kc5M8=` | `0nz1YdHu/JDmS6CImcZgOj9Y960sJOPrbZHAJO107qW0=` |
| Private | `0WBFFicIHbivRZXAlO7tPs7rCX6s7u2OIMJ2mx9nwg0w=` | `08lUw93C+xzdxBcsYOoPVjzn8IHPJtnJW9Y/WyEu4v64=` |

## Compile Actyx

If you followed the previous section, you will already be halfway there.
You should have downloaded the Actyx source code and be in the `rust/actyx` repository.

:::caution Don't forget the dependencies!

<details>
<summary>Actyx depends on `protoc` and compilation will fail if it isn't installed on your system. Open to learn how to install it on your system.</summary>

<Tabs>
<Windows>

Using Chocolatey:

```powershell
choco install protoc
```

</Windows>
<Mac>

Using brew:

```bash
brew install protobuf
```

</Mac>
<Linux>

Using `apt`:

```bash
apt-get install protobuf-compiler
```

</Linux>
</Tabs>

</details>

:::

1. Compile Actyx, using your public key.

```bash
export AX_PUBLIC_KEY="$(cat <public_key>)"
cargo build --bin actyx --release --locked
```

Where `public_key` is the path to the public key you generated in the previous section.

2. (Optional) Double check that your public key is, in fact, embedded in the Actyx binary:

```bash
strings target/release/actyx | grep $AX_PUBLIC_KEY
```
