Authorized apps are apps for which you purchased an app license key so that they can run in production.
If you want to deploy an app to or remove an app from your nodes in production, you need to manage their licenses stored in the node settings.
This how-to guide explains how you can manage your authorized apps.

:::info want to buy license keys?

You can manage license keys in the settings of the node on which the app is running under `licensing/apps/...` as shown below:

```json title="Managing authorized apps"
...
"licensing": {
    "node": "<string: node license key>",
    "apps": {
        "com.actyx.example": "<string: app license key>"
    }
}
...
```

:::tip still have app license keys for Actyx v1.x?
The format of app and node license keys changed. If you have license keys that you purchased for Actyx v1.x, please get in touch with your contact at Actyx or write an e-mail to developer@actyx.io and we will send you new license keys.

You can add or delete authorized apps from the node by simply editing the node settings.
For this, you need to first select the node you want to manage from the **Node Overview**.

![node-overview](/images/how-to/app-auth/node-overview.png)

Next, navigate to the **Settings** tab which displays the currently saved node settings.
Now, you can simply remove an entry from the `apps` array or add one, depending on what you want to do.

In order to add or delete authorized apps from the node, you need to use the [`ax settings get`](../../reference/cli/settings/get.md) and the [`ax settings set`](../../reference/cli/settings/set.md) commands, as shown in the example below.

The following command creates a text file called `example` that lists the currently authorized apps on your node running at `192.168.1.211`:

```text
ax settings get com.actyx/licensing/apps 192.168.1.211 > example
```

Now open the file, and add the license you want to add to the node:

```yaml
com.actyx.example: '2VK3DWKBZEPJCHJ7ZGP83OT1EDUX67ZWDYNZ222EUZ57Q4MNC5QZGDHZYI8ROSFN88SYRDK8YXAQ235NKLIZC9Y2ZCVTZHJDVI1Z'
```

<!-- TODO check and if necessary change license key format once implemented -->

You can then use this file to configure the list of authorized apps:

```text
ax settings set com.actyx/licensing/apps @example 192.168.1.211
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>
