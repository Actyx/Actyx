# How to deploy your own Actyx swarm to production

:::info

This guide pertains to launching Actyx in "production mode".
If you're still testing Actyx or developing your application, set the node licensing
to `development` in the node settings.

```json
"licensing": {
    "node": "development"
}
```

Before we start, it's important to define what "your own" means, this is because official
Actyx releases are embedded with a public key to ensure that applications running on an
official release are certified by Actyx.

When rolling your own Actyx deployment, you will want to set this value to your public key.
To do so, you first need to generate an Ed25519 key pair, in case you do not know how to do so
you can refer to [GitHub's tutorial](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent#generating-a-new-ssh-key) on the topic.

After you have your key pair, we need to download Actyx and compile it using your key.

1. Start by cloning the repository.

```bash
git clone git@github.com:Actyx/Actyx.git
```

2. Navigate to `rust/actyx`.

```bash
cd rust/actyx
```

3. Compile Actyx, using your public key.

```bash
export AX_PUBLIC_KEY="$(base64 -i <path_to_your_public_key>)"
cargo build --bin actyx --release --locked
```

4. (Optional) Double check that your public key in fact embedded in the Actyx binary:

```bash
strings target/release/actyx | grep $AX_PUBLIC_KEY
```
