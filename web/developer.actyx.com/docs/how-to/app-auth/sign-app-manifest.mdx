In order for your app to access the Events API, it needs to be authenticated with the node it is running on.
This works by providing the node with a signed app manifest.
This how-to guide explains the steps you need to follow to sign your app manifest.
You can sign an app manifest with the Actyx CLI in the command line or with the Actyx Node Manager.
Independent of the tool you are using, the manifest needs to meet a few requirements.

1. The manifest must be a `.json` file. Any other file format will be rejected by the CLI and the Node Manager.
2. The manifest has three required properties:

   ```json
   {
     "appId": "<string: app ID>",
     "displayName": "<string: display name>",
     "version": "<string: version>"
   }
   ```

   One additional property that is reserved by Actyx is the `signature` property.
   This property is added or updated by the CLI or the Node Manager when signing a manifest.
   Apart from that, you can add any additional properties describing your app metadata such as the path to an app icon.

:::info Updating the signature
Note that every time you change one of the three properties listed above, you need to renew the manifest signature since the three properties are used to create it.

To sign an app manifest with the Actyx Node Manager, please navigate to the **App Signing** section in the left panel.

Next, specify the path to your developer certificate and the path to the manifest you want to sign.

Note that when signing a manifest, the Node Manager updates the file you provided rather than saving a new one.

To sign an app manifest with the Actyx CLI, you need to use the [`ax apps sign`](../../reference/cli/apps/sign.mdx) command as shown in the following example:

```text title="Example Usage"
ax apps sign "/Users/ax/Apps/Dashboard/manifest.json" "/Users/ax/Documents/certificate.txt"
```

Note that when you sign a manifest, the CLI updates the file you provided rather than saving a new one.
