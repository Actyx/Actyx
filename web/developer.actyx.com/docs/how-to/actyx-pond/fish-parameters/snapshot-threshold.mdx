Whenever more than `snapshotThreshold` new events are observed over a period longer than one hour, a snapshot is created.

`snapshotThreshold` overwrites the default snapshot threshold set in the Pond. The default value is `1014`.

```ts
export const MyFish: Fish<State, Event> = {
        fishId: FishId.of(...),
        initialState: undefined,
        where: ...,
        onEvent: (state, event) => { ... },
        snapshotThreshold: 420 // set fish threshold
    }
```

For details on snapshot handling and performance implications, please refer to [the Pond snapshot documentation](https://developer.actyx.com/docs/how-to/actyx-pond/guides/snapshots).
