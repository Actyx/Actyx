If a node has no authorized users yet, **the first user to interact with a node is automatically added to its authorized users**.
If you want to manage which users are authorized to manage a node, you can do so by adding the user's public key to the `authorizedUsers` property in the node settings:

```yaml
authorizedUsers:
    - 0WBOOWqi2Ub5SPi5btKN5H5BzFPcjyULwUKUN2dWVsMI= ## Public key of an authorized user
```

The following example assumes that you are already authorized and now want to add a user with the public key `09a36bJYYYSusZuQoum6x2zgqtHxYP31ov0RHRWIzwVo=`

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs'
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem'

<Tabs
  groupId="os"
  defaultValue={"cli"}
  values={[
    { label: 'Actyx CLI', value: 'cli' },
    { label: 'Node Manager', value: 'node-manager' },
  ]}
>

<TabItem value="cli">

The following command creates a file called `example` that lists the currently authorized users on your node running at `localhost`:

```text
ax settings get --local com.actyx/admin/authorizedUsers localhost > example
```

Now open the file, and add the public keys of the users you want to authorize:

```yaml
- 0WBOOWqi2Ub5SPi5btKN5H5BzFPcjyULwUKUN2dWVsMI= # Public key that was already authorized
- 09a36bJYYYSusZuQoum6x2zgqtHxYP31ov0RHRWIzwVo= # Public key you want to authorize
```

You can then use this file to configure the list of authorized users:

```text
ax settings set --local com.actyx/admin/authorizedUsers @example localhost
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="node-manager">

TODO

</TabItem>
</Tabs>
