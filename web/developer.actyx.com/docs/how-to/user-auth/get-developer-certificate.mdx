You need a developer certificate for [signing an app manifests](../app-auth/sign-app-manifest.mdx). This guide shows you how to obtain one.

:::tip no need to sign during development
During testing or development, you can just use the app ID `com.example.*` which does not require a signature in order to interact with Actyx. Check out [this guide for more information on signing apps](../app-auth/sign-app-manifest.mdx).
:::

If you want to receive a developer certificate, please enter your e-mail address [in this form](https://oliver454918.typeform.com/to/gqSIzIwm) and we will send you one within 24 hours.

Your developer certificate is linked to the domain name of your e-mail address. You can therefore only use it for signing app manifests with an app ID that matches your reverse domain name. 
For example, if your e-mail address was `developer@actyx.com`, you could use the certificate for signing app manifests with `com.actyx.*` app IDs.

For more information on authentication and authorization, please refer to our [conceptual guide](../../conceptual/authentication-and-authorization.mdx).
