In order to be able to [sign an app manifest](../app-auth/sign-app-manifest.mdx), you need a developer certificate.

:::tip only sign apps for production systems
You need a developer certificate for signing apps which we only advise to do for production systems. During testing or development, you can just use the appId `com.example.*` which does not require a signature in order to interact with Actyx. Check out [this guide for more information on signing apps](../app-auth/sign-app-manifest.mdx).

If you want to receive a developer certificate, please enter your e-mail address [here](https://oliver454918.typeform.com/to/gqSIzIwm) and we will send you one within 24 hours.

Your developer certificate is linked to the domain name of your e-mail address. You can therefore only use it for signing app manifests with an appId that match your reverse domain name. For example, if your e-mail address was `developer@actyx.com`, you could use the certificate for signing app manifests with `com.actyx.*` appIds.

For more information on how app authentication and authorization works, please refer to our [conceptual guide](../../conceptual/authentication-and-authorization.mdx).
