When developing on the Actyx platform, the way you package your apps is up to you.

## Choosing the right tool

Depending on the use-case, the kind of application and the operating system your app will run on eventually, the package kind and the way you package it may vary.
The commonality however is, that you need to package a project built with Javascript/Typescript, HTML and CSS into something that the desktop devices you use, can run.

Actyx today supports Windows, macOS and Linux as desktop platforms, so your Actyx app needs to be packaged into an operating-system specific package, that can be executed.
There are many tools out there that specialize on this workflow.
Here are a couple of options you have:

- [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/docs)
- [Apache Cordova](https://cordova.apache.org/)
- [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/docs)
