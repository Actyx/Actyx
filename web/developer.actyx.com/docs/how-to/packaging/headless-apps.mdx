When developing on the Actyx low-code platform, the way you package your apps is up to you.

## Choosing the right tool

Depending on the use-case, the kind of application and the operating system your app will run on eventually, the package kind and the way you package it may vary.
To package applications that are meant to run on headless devices such as machine gateways, we recommend to build your own [Docker Image](https://docs.docker.com/develop/develop-images/dockerfile_best-practices/).

:::info
Note that ActyxOS on Docker should only be used if you are familiar with Docker, as Docker frequently poses problems that are hard to debug.
