When developing on the Actyx platform, the way you package your apps is up to you.

## Choosing the right tool

Depending on the use-case, the kind of application and the operating system your app will run on eventually, the package kind and the way you package it may vary.
The commonality however is, that you need to package a project built with Javascript/Typescript, HTML and CSS into something that the mobile devices you use, can run.

Actyx today supports Android as the mobile OS platform, so your Actyx app needs to be packaged into an [Android application package (APK)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_application_package).
There are many tools out there that specialize in this workflow.
Here are a couple of options you have:

- [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/)
- [Apache Cordova](https://cordova.apache.org/)
- [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/docs)
- [Capacitor](https://capacitorjs.com/)
