This how-to guide explains how you can manage app licenses.
If you deploy apps to or remove them from a node in production, you need to manage their licenses stored in the node's settings.
Without a valid license, an app does not receive an auth token and can therefore not interact with the Events API.

:::tip No need for licenses during development
By default, your node is configured as follows and you therefore do not need to store an app license in your node's settings for receiving an Auth token:

```json title="Node settings example"
...
"licensing": {
    "node": "development"
}
...
```

You can manage the app license keys in the settings of the node on which the app is running under `licensing/apps/...` as shown below:

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs'
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem'

<Tabs
  groupId="tool"
  defaultValue={"nm"}
  values={[
    { label: "Node Manager", value: "nm" },
    { label: "CLI", value: "cli" }
  ]}
>


<TabItem value="nm">


You can add or delete licensed apps from the node by simply editing the node settings.
For this, you need to first select the node you want to manage from the **Node Overview**.

Next, navigate to the **Settings** tab which displays the currently saved node settings.
Now, you can simply remove an entry from the `apps` array or add one, depending on what you want to do.

![settings-02](/images/how-to/app-auth/settings-02.png)

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="cli">


In order to add or delete authorized apps from the node, you need to use the [`ax settings get`](../../reference/cli/settings/get.md) and the [`ax settings set`](../../reference/cli/settings/set.md) commands, as shown in the example below.

The following command creates a text file called `example` that lists the currently authorized apps on your node running at `192.168.1.211`:

```text
ax settings get /licensing/apps 192.168.1.211 > example
```

Now open the file, and add the license you want to add to the node:

```yaml
com.actyx.example: '2VK3DWKBZEPJCHJ7ZGP83OT1EDUX67ZWDYNZ222EUZ57Q4MNC5QZGDHZYI8ROSFN88SYRDK8YXAQ235NKLIZC9Y2ZCVTZHJDVI1Z'
```

You can then use this file to configure the list of authorized apps:

```text
ax settings set /licensing/apps @example 192.168.1.211
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::tip still have app license keys for Actyx v1.x?
The format of app and node license keys changed. If you have license keys that you purchased for Actyx v1.x, please get in touch with your contact at Actyx or write an e-mail to developer@actyx.io and we will send you new license keys.
