This how-to guide explains how you can manage node licenses.
If you want to run a node in production, you need to have a valid node license which is stored in the node's settings.

:::tip No need for a license during development
By default, your node is configured to be in development. You do not need to provide a license until you run it in production.

You can manage license keys in the settings of the node on which the app is running under `licensing/node/...` as shown below:

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs'
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem'

<Tabs
  groupId="tool"
  defaultValue={"nm"}
  values={[
    { label: "Node Manager", value: "nm" },
    { label: "CLI", value: "cli" }
  ]}
>

<TabItem value="nm">

You can add or delete authorized apps from the node by simply editing the node settings.
For this, you need to first select the node you want to manage from the **Node Overview**.

Next, navigate to the **Settings** tab which displays the currently saved node settings.
Now, you can simply change the value for `node` under `licensing`.

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="cli">

In order to change the license of your node, you need to use the [`ax settings set`](../../reference/cli/settings/set.md) commands, as shown in the example below:

```text
ax settings set /licensing/node "2VK3DWKBZEPJCHJ7ZGP83OT1EDUX67ZWDYNZ222EUZ57Q4MNC5QZGDHZYI8ROSFN88SYRDK8YXAQ235NKLIZC9Y2ZCVTZHJDVI1Z" 192.168.1.211
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>
