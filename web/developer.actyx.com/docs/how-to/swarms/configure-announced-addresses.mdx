You need to configure the `announceAddresses` settings if the following statements are both true:

- there is NAT between the discovery helper node and your other nodes, **and**
- one (or more) of your nodes is a Docker node, and the Actyx container is not running with the `--network=host` option

In this case, you have to manually configure the address of your node's host in the `announceAddress` property in the node settings:

```yml
announceAddress: # Manually configured addresses to announce
  - /ip4/192.168.1.101/tcp/4001
  # These must be multiaddresses, i.e. ip4/<YOUR_IP>/tcp/4001
```

You can configure it by using the Actyx CLI or the Node Manager. The following examples assume that the IP address of your Docker node is 192.168.2.10:

<Tabs
  groupId="os"
  defaultValue={"cli"}
  values={[
    { label: 'Actyx CLI', value: 'cli' },
    { label: 'Node Manager', value: 'manager' },
  ]}
>

<TabItem value="cli">

You can use the output from above and `ax settings set` to configure it:

```text
ax settings set /swarm/announceAddresses [/ip4/192.168.2.10/tcp/4001] localhost
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="manager">

Go to the settings tab change the `announceAddresses` property and press save:

![announce-address-node-manager](../../../static/images/how-to/swarms/announce-addresses.png)

</TabItem>
</Tabs>
