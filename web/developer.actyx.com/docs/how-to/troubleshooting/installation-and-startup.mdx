### Startup errors

Actyx uses a few IP ports for node communication and internal services.
In order for Actyx to run flawlessly, please make sure that the following ports are free:

1. `4001`: Used for inter-node communication

3. `4454`: Exposes the [Event Service](../../reference/events-api) (only on localhost)

4. `4458`: Used for communication with the Actyx CLI or Node Manager

### Installation errors on Windows

If you receive the following error during installation, please close the Windows Event Viewer and press **Retry**:
