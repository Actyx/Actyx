### Startup errors

ActyxOS uses a few IP ports for node communication and internal services.
In order for ActyxOS to run flawlessly, please make sure that the following ports are free:

1. `4001`: Used for inter-node communication

2. `4243`: Exposes a WebSocket endpoint for Actyx Pond (only on localhost)

3. `4454`: Exposes the [Event Service](../../reference/event-service.mdx) (only on localhost)

4. `4457`: Used for communication with the Actyx CLI or Node Manager

5. `8080`: Exposes an [IPFS Gateway](https://docs.ipfs.io/concepts/ipfs-gateway/) (only on localhost)
