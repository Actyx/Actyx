## Node to Actyx CLI connection error

First, check that you entered the right IP in the ax command.
If you still cannot connect, the output of the command you entered or the Node Manager returns one of the following errors:

- **ERR_USER_UNAUTHENTICATED** or **ERR_PATH_INVALID** indicates an authentication error. You either have not set up a user key, or you specified the wrong path to your user keys. Please refer to our [guide on user keys](../user-auth/set-up-user-keys.mdx) for more information.

- **ERR_USER_UNAUTHORIZED** indicates that you are not authorized on the node you are trying to interact with. Please refer to our [guide on managing authorized users](../user-auth/manage-authorized-users.mdx) for more information.

- **ERR_NODE_UNREACHABLE**: This means that Actyx is not running on your node, or you cannot connect to that node. Please start Actyx as described in [this guide](../local-development/install-actyx.mdx). Please also check that your development machine and your node are in the same network, and your firewall(s) allows them to connect via port `4458`. You can debug the connection as explained in [this guide](../monitoring-debugging/network-requirements).
