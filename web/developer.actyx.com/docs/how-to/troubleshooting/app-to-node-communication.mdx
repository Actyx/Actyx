## Apps communicating with Actyx on Docker

By default, the Actyx Pond and all SDKs are trying to connect to Actyx on localhost. If your Actyx and app container are not both using the host's networking directly via `--network=host` (only available on Linux), you therefore need to set an environment variable to let the Pond or SDK know where to reach Actyx.

### In the `docker run` commmand

When running your app container, you need to add the following flag:

`-e AX_STORE_URI="<IP address of the Actyx container>:4454/api/v2`

:::tip Running macOS or Windows?
On macOS or windows, you can just use `host.docker.internal` instead of the IP address of your Actyx container.
:::

### In a Docker Compose file

This is an exemplary docker-compose file:

```yaml
version: "3.9"
services:
  actyx:
    image: actyx/actyx:2.0.1
    privileged: true
    ports:
      - "4001:4001"
      - "4454:4454"
      - "4458:4458"
    volumes:
      - actyx_data:/data
  app:
    image: example-app
    restart: always
    environment: 
        - AX_STORE_URI=actyx:4454/api/v2
    depends_on: 
        - actyx
volumes:
  actyx_data: {}
```
