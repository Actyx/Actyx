Actyx has lots of amazing features that make factory automation easier. But, like any technology, that means there is some jargon that can be confusing to newcomers.
So let's define the basics so you find your way around our documentation.

### ActyxOS

ActyxOS is a piece of software that you deploy to your device. It is packaged in various formats, e.g. as a Linux binary or as an Android apk â€” check out our reference documentation for supported operating systems and architectures to find out more.

### Node

An ActyxOS node is a device that runs ActyxOS. The device can be physical, e.g. a tablet, or virtual, e.g. a virtual machine. There is one special type of node, see [bootstrap node](#bootstrap-node) below.

### Swarm

An ActyxOS swarm is a group of ActyxOS nodes that are configured with the same Swarm Key. Nodes inside a swarm are connected to each other and exchange events. For more information on how discovery inside a swarm works, check out our guide on [peer discovery](peer-discovery.mdx).

### Bootstrap node

A boostrap node is an ActyxOS node like any other with one exception: It does not store or distribute events. It only connects to other nodes and its purpose is to serve as a directory for all nodes that form a swarm. When a new node connects to the bootstrap node, it gets a list of all other nodes in the swarm which facilitates peer discovery. Check out our guide on [peer discovery](peer-discovery.mdx) for more information.

### App

An app is a piece of software that runs on a device that also runs ActyxOS. On that device, the app interacts locally with ActyxOS through ActyxOS's APIs. The packaging of the app (e.g. as a Docker container or Android apk) depends on the device it is running on.

### Pond

The Actyx Pond is a programming framework for writing apps for ActyxOS. It is available on [npm](http://npmjs.com/package/@actyx/pond). Check out our [how-to guides](/docs/how-to-guides/actyx-pond/introduction) for more information.

### Fish

A fish is a concept of the Actyx Pond. It is the main programming unit used when writing apps with the Actyx Pond. Check out our [how-to guides](/docs/how-to-guides/actyx-pond/introduction) for more information.
