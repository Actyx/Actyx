This conceptual guide explains the architecture and components of ActyxOS.

## ActyxOS architecture

:::warning Console Service and runtimes are deprecated
Both runtimes and the Console Service are deprecated. They will be removed in a future version of ActyxOS. For information on how to run apps instead, please check out the [section **Packaging & Deployment** in our How-to guides](../how-to-guides/overview.mdx).
:::

An Actyx node consists of the following components:

- **Swarm**: used by nodes for internode communication. This components enables nodes to discover each other and exchange events. By default, it binds to port 4001.
- **Admin**: used by admins and developers for management of nodes. The Actyx CLI as well as the node manager use the Admin interface to interact with an Actyx node. By default, it binds to port 4457.
- **Event Service**: used by apps for publishing to, as well as querying and subscribing events from, event streams. By default, it binds to port 4454.
- **Console Service**: used by apps for publishing logs to ActyxOS. By default, it binds to port 4457.
- **Webview runtime**: used to deploy Actyx webview apps to ActyxOS on Android and run them
- **Docker runtime**: used to deploy Actyx docker apps to ActyxOS on Android and run them
