ActyxOS provides five core services and, where applicable, associated APIs or deployment tools. These services either provide stand-alone functionality or allow you to build your own apps.

Refer to the following sections to learn more about the different services:

- Learn about the WebView Runtime and the Docker Runtime in the [Running Apps](guides/running-apps.md) section
- Learn about the Event Service in the [Event Streams](guides/event-streams.md) guide
- The Blob Service is still in Alpha, but you can check out it's [preliminary API](/docs/os/api/blob-service)
- Learn how to use the Console Service in the [Logging](guides/logging.md) and [App Runtimes](advanced-guides/app-runtimes.md) sections
