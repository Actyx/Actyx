ActyxOS makes it easy to run distributed applications on multiple nodes. It is a piece of software that allows you to run your own apps on one or more edge devices and have these apps seamlesslesy communicate and share data with each other.

## Features

- ðŸ’Œ **Decentralized data dissementation**
  - Share events between nodes in real-time
  - No central servers or messages brokers
- ðŸ—ƒ **Distributed data storage**
  - Store events in the swarm for later consumption
- ðŸ’¿ **Edge runtimes**
  - Run web-apps or docker apps on edge devices
  - Easily package, deploy, configure and monitor apps

Our goal is to allow people to program the naturally dezentralized collaboration of humans and machines.
