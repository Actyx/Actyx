ActyxOS can be installed on either Docker or Android.

## Installing on Android

_ActyxOS on Android_ is [publicly available in the Google Play store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.actyx.os.android). Just open the Google Play store on your device, search for ActyxOS and install it.

In order to run ActyxOS on your Android device, it must:

- run Android 6.0 or above
- have at least 2GB of RAM

## Installing on Docker

In order to install ActyxOS on a Docker host you will need to have a working installation of Docker (see [the installation documentation](https://docs.docker.com/install/)).

ActyxOS is published on [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/), so start the image as follows:

<Tabs
  defaultValue="windows"
  values={[
    { label: 'Windows/Mac', value: 'windows', },
    { label: 'Linux', value: 'unix', },
  ]
}>
<TabItem value="windows">

```bash
docker run -it --rm -v actyxos-data:/data --privileged -p 4001:4001 -p 4457:4457 -p 4243:4243 -p 4454:4454 actyx/os
```

:::note
Since `--network=host` is not supported on Windows or Mac we have to explicitly expose the needed network ports.
This is also true of any ports your apps may want to expose, youâ€™d need to add them to this list.
:::

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="unix">

```bash
docker run -it --rm -v actyxos-data:/data --privileged --network=host actyx/os
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

ActyxOS should now be running in your Docker environment.

## Required ports

ActyxOS currently requires five ports to operate.
Before starting ActyxOS make sure that these ports are not already in use by another programn.

- `4001` - Used for internode communication
- `4243` - Exposes a WebSocket endpoint for the Actyx Pond
- `4454` - Exposes the [Event Service](/os/api/event-service.md)
- `4457` - Exposes the [Console Service](/os/api/console-service.md)
- `8080` - Exposes an [IPFS Gateway](https://docs.ipfs.io/concepts/ipfs-gateway/)

## Communicate with the node

In order to check on its status and interact with the node, you need to download the Actyx CLI (`ax` or `ax.exe`) from <https://downloads.actyx.com> and add it to your path.

You can then check on your ActyxOS node:

```bash
ax nodes ls --local <DEVICE_IP>
```

Please refer to the [Actyx CLI documentation](/docs/cli/getting-started) for installation instructions or to learn more about using the Actyx CLI.
