ActyxOS can be installed on either Docker or Android.

## Installing on Android

In order to install ActyxOS on an Android device you need:

- a device running Android 6.0 or above with at least 4GB of RAM
- [`adb`](https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/adb) running on your machine (see [this installation guide](https://www.xda-developers.com/install-adb-windows-macos-linux/))

Download the latest version of the ActyxOS APK from https://downloads.actyx.com and install the APK on your Android device using [`adb`](https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/adb):

```
adb install axos.apk
```

ActyxOS should now be installed and running on your Android device.

## Installing on Docker

In order to install ActyxOS on a Docker host you will need to have a working installation of Docker (see [the installation documentation](https://docs.docker.com/install/)).

ActyxOS is published on DockerHub, so start the image as follows:

<Tabs
  defaultValue="windows"
  values={[
    { label: 'Windows/Mac', value: 'windows', },
    { label: 'Linux', value: 'unix', },
  ]
}>
<TabItem value="windows">

```
docker pull actyx/os
docker run -it --rm -v actyxos-data:/data --privileged -p 4001:4001 -p 4457:4457 actyx/os
```

:::note
Since `--network=host` is not supported on Windows or Mac we have to explicitly expose the needed network ports.
This is also true of any ports your apps may want to expose, youâ€™d need to add them to this list.
:::

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="unix">

```
docker pull actyx/os
docker run -it --rm -v actyxos-data:/data --privileged --network=host actyx/os
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

ActyxOS should now be running in your Docker environment.


## Communicate with the node

In order to check on its status and interact with the node, you need to download the Actyx CLI (`ax` or `ax.exe`) from https://downloads.actyx.com and add it to your path.

You can then check on your ActyxOS node:

```
ax nodes ls --local <DEVICE_IP>
```

Please refer to the [Actyx CLI documentation](/docs/cli) to learn more about using the Actyx CLI.

If you want to try out ActyxOS by deploying some sample apps, please take a look at [the Quickstart Guide](../../quickstart.md#run-the-app-in-dev-mode).
