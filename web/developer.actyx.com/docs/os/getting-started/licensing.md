## During development

You are free to use ActyxOS for development. Please set the ActyxOS license in your node settings to `development`. The same applies for app keys.

## Running production

You may only run ActyxOS in production if you have purchased and own a valid license for every production node (i.e. installation of ActyxOS) as stated in the _Actyx Software License Agreement_. The same applies for running apps in production; you must have purchased and own a valid app key.

For more information about pricing check out [our website](https://www.actyx.com/pricing). Please [contact our sales team](https://www.actyx.com/contact) if you would like to purchase ActyxOS licenses or ActyxOS App Keys.
