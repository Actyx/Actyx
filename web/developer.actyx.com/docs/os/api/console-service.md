title: Console Service
---

With the **Console Service** you generate logs from your app for monitoring and debugging.

## Overview

Being able to access app logs is a key requirement of any developer building, monitoring or debugging an app, and of any administrator running an app in production. The Console Service provides you&mdash;as an app developer&mdash;with the tools necessary to create and access your app's logs.

Key capabilities:

- Provide developer APIs for producing structured or unstructured logs
- Automatically capture and log `stdout` and `stderr` output (only Docker Runtime)
- Automatically capture and log `window.console` output (only WebView Runtime)
- Enable local or remote access to historical or real-time logs

:::note Local access only
The Console Service currently only supports local access to logs, i.e. when you are in the same network as the edge device. We plan to introduce remote logging in 2020. Stay tuned for more.

## Basics

### Structured vs. unstructured logs

Traditionally, logs were produced, persisted, and consumed as lines of text. This way of logging is referred to as _unstructured logging_. A traditional log file might look like this:

```
# File app.log
MyApp-1.0.3::console | 2019-09-11T21:46:12.106Z [info] Starting app...
MyApp-1.0.3::console | 2019-09-11T21:46:12.113Z [debug] Setting route '/activities'
MyApp-1.0.3::console | 2019-09-11T21:46:12.113Z [debug] 34 activities loaded
MyApp-1.0.3::console | 2019-09-11T21:46:12.113Z [info] User 'jdoe' registered
MyApp-1.0.3::console | 2019-09-11T21:46:12.114Z [debug] Setting route '/preferences'
```

This file contains unstructured logs&mdash;one per line&mdash; generated by an app. Metadata and actual content are all packed into a single line. Whilst these types of logs are easy to read as a human, they are not ideal for machine analysis.

Whilst ActyxOS supports this type of logging, we favor _structured logging_, where metadata and content are cleanly separated and each log message is produced in a machine-readable format. Consider the first log line shown above, this time in a structured format (with the information highlighted):

```javascript{4}
{
    "logTimestamp": "2019-09-11T21:46:12.106Z",
    "severity": "info",
    "message": "Starting app...",
    "logName": "ax.os.docker.stdout",
    "nodeId": "9d6083b3-3e06-4e59-b59c-bdfee1eae8cb",
    "nodeName": "EdgeDevice1",
    "sequenceNumber": 42,
    "producerName": "com.mycompany.myapp",
    "producerVersion": "1.0.3",
    "additionalData": {
        "customKey": "custom value"
    },
    "labels": {
        "com.app-builder-ltd.gdpr-relevant": "false"
    }
}
```

:::info Reserved namespaces `ax.*` and `actyx.*`
Both `ax.*` and `actyx.*` are reserved namespaces and aliases for `com.actyx.*`. This is done to save valuable bytes going through the network.
:::

This structured log provides significantly more information than could be contained in a single line in any readable fashion. Given its JSON-format, it is also easy to programmatically parse for automated analysis or interactive investigation.

:::note You can generate unstructured logs with ActyxOS
Whilst not recommended, the Console Service supports unstructured logging. Refer to the usage examples below for more information about how that works.
:::

### Log lifecycle and persistence

Logs are generated when your app runs. As you may not always be available to immediately capture ephemeral logs, the Console Service automatically persists logs for you. This persistence means that you can access logs at a later point in time.

Given disk constraints and configuration options, ActyxOS may at some point delete logs from the edge device. The deletion happens in a FIFO fashion, with the oldest logs being deleted first, irrespective of level.

:::info Long-term persistence with the upcoming Actyx Console
The Actyx Console is planned for release in 2020. It will allow for logs to automatically be sent from the edge device to the scalable, cloud-based Console. Then you will be able to access logs long after they have been deleted from the edge device. Stay tuned for release updates.
:::

## Usage

Creating high-quality applications and providing associated support means you must be able to see what is going on with your apps. The Console Service gives you the tools to do so.

### Unstructured logging

Unstructured logging is supported for both Docker apps and WebView apps.

#### Docker apps

The business logic running in a docker container can output to [stdout](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_streams#Standard_output_(stdout)) or [stderr](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_streams#Standard_error_(stderr)). The ActyxOS [Docker Runtime](../advances-guides/app-runtimes.md#docker-runtime) automatically captures these outputs and transforms them into structured log messages of the following standard shape:

```javascript
{
    "logTimestamp": "2019-09-11T21:46:12.106Z",
    "severity": "info",
    "message": "Your message",
    "logName": "ax.os.docker.stdout",
    "producerName": "myDockerApp.name",
    "producerVersion": "1.0.3",
    "additionalData": {
        "yourKey": "yourValue"
    },
    "labels": {
        "com.app-builder-ltd.gdpr-relevant": "false"
    }
}
```

:::note
All data streamed to `stdout` or `stderr` will have the same `info` log level, the property `logName` will be accordingly populated automatically with value `ax.os.docker.stdout` or `ax.os.docker.stderr`.
:::

#### WebView apps

WebView apps have&mdash;via JavaScript&mdash;access to the `console` object. The Console Service captures messages logged with the following functions:

- `console.debug` mapped to `debug` log level
- `console.warn` mapped to `warn` log level
- `console.info` mapped to `info` log level
- `console.log` mapped to `info` log level
- `console.error` mapped to `error` log level

The logged string is transformed in a similar fashion as for Docker apps.

### Structured logging

Structured logging&mdash;the preferred method&mdash;is possible using the Console Service's local HTTP API. You publish logs by submitting `POST` requests to the `http://localhost:4457/api/v1/logs` endpoint.

:::warning Access only via `localhost`
The API can only be accessed locally, i.e. at `localhost`. It is not meant to be accessed from other devices. The Console Service automatically distributes published logs in the background. As a developer, you only need to interact with the local service and API.
:::

The following code example shows how you can do this from a Node.js-based docker app.

```javascript
const fetch = require('node-fetch')

const myMessage = {
    logTimestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
    severity: "info",
    message: "Your message",
    logName: "yourLogName",
    producerName: "com.mycompany.myapp",
    producerVersion: "1.0.3",
    additionalData: {
        yourKey: "Your value"
    },
    labels: {
        "com.app-builder-ltd.gdpr-relevant": "false"
    }
}

fetch('http://localhost:4457/api/v1/logs', {
    method: 'POST',
    body: JSON.stringify(myMessage),
    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
})
```

Using `cURL` from `bash` as an alternative, you would post a structured message using the following command:

```bash
echo '
{
    "severity": "info",
    "message": "Your message",
    "logName": "yourLogName",
    "producerName": "com.mycompany.myapp",
    "producerVersion": "1.0.3",
    "additionalData": {
        "yourKey": "Your value"
    },
    "labels": {
        "com.app-builder-ltd.gdpr-relevant": "false"
    }
}
'\
| curl \
    -X "POST" \
    -d @- \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -H "Accept: application/json" \
    http://localhost:4457/api/v1/logs
```

:::note
If "logTimestamp" is omitted the Console Service will add it automatically for you.
:::

### Accessing log messages

Until the release of the Actyx Console in 2020, logs can only be accessed using the [Actyx CLI](../../cli.md) with the `ax logs` command. You can either retrieve all logs on the edge device or tail all logs generated from the time you execute the command.

:::note
Until the release of the Actyx Console, logs can only be accessed locally. In order for this to work, you must use the `--local` flag when calling Actyx CLI commands.
:::

Example:

```
ax logs --tail --local EdgeDevice1
> MyApp-1.0.3::console | 2019-09-11T21:46:12.106Z [info] Starting app...
> MyApp-1.0.3::console | 2019-09-11T21:46:12.113Z [debug] Setting route '/activities'
> MyApp-1.0.3::console | 2019-09-11T21:46:12.113Z [debug] 34 activities loaded
> MyApp-1.0.3::console | 2019-09-11T21:46:12.113Z [info] User 'jdoe' registered
> MyApp-1.0.3::console | 2019-09-11T21:46:12.114Z [debug] Setting route '/preferences'
```

You can also retrieve logs in their **structured** format using the `--format=json` flag with the `ax logs` command:

```bash
ax logs --tail --local --format=json EdgeDevice1 | jq
>{
    "logTimestamp": "2019-09-11T21:46:12.106Z",
    "severity": "info",
    "message": "Starting app...",
    "logName": "ax.os.stdout",
    "nodeId": "9d6083b3-3e06-4e59-b59c-bdfee1eae8cb",
    "nodeName": "EdgeDevice1",
    "sequenceNumber": 42,
    "producerName": "com.mycompany.myapp",
    "producerVersion": "1.0.3",
    "additionalData": {
        "customKey": "custom value"
    },
    "labels": {
        "com.app-builder-ltd.gdpr-relevant": "false"
    }
}
```
