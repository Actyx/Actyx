title: Running Apps
---

Running an app on ActyxOS requires you to deploy the app, configure the app and start the app. Let's run through an example.

## Deploy the app

If you followed the previous guide, [Building Apps](building-apps.md), you should be in the directory called `my-app`. In this directory you should have a file called `com.example.myapp-1.0.0.tar.gz` that contains your packaged ActyxOS app.

To deploy the app use the [Actyx CLI](../../cli/getting-started) as follows:

```bash
ax apps deploy com.example.myapp-1.0.0.tar.gz --local localhost
```

:::tip Use the device IP for remote nodes
In the above example we assumed you are running ActyxOS locally. To deploy to a remote node, simple replace `localhost` with the node's IP address.

## Start the app

If you run `ax apps ls --local localhost` now you should see the following:

```bash
+-----------+-------------------+---------+----------+---------+----------+---------+---------+
| NODE ID   | APP ID            | VERSION | ENABLED  | STATE   | SETTINGS | LICENSE | STARTED |
+-----------+-------------------+---------+----------+---------+----------+---------+---------+
| localhost | com.example.myapp | 1.0.0   | DISABLED | STOPPED | VALID    | VALID   |         |
+-----------+-------------------+---------+----------+---------+----------+---------+---------+
```

What this is telling you is that your app is currently not enabled, stopped and has valid settings. In order to get the app into a running state, you need to start it as follows:

```bash
ax apps start com.example.myapp --local localhost
```

Running `ax apps ls --local localhost` again you should now see that the app has been started and is running (`STATE`):

```bash
+-----------+-------------------+---------+---------+---------+----------+---------+-------------------------------------+
| NODE ID   | APP ID            | VERSION | ENABLED | STATE   | SETTINGS | LICENSE | STARTED                             |
+-----------+-------------------+---------+---------+---------+----------+---------+-------------------------------------+
| localhost | com.example.myapp | 1.0.0   | ENABLED | RUNNING | VALID    | VALID   | 2020-04-06T13:54:45.003324400+00:00 |
+-----------+-------------------+---------+---------+---------+----------+---------+-------------------------------------+
```

## Access app logs

If you want to access the logs being generated by ActyxOS and your app, simply use the following Actyx CLI command:

```bash
ax logs tail --follow --local localhost
```

## Stop the app

To stop the app run the following Actyx CLI command:

```bash
ax apps stop com.example.myapp --local localhost
```
