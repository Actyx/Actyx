Welcome to the Advanced Tutorial. You are going to learn advanced Actyx Pond programming concepts by implementing a simplified real-world production use case with the Actyx Platform.

This tutorial is divided into several sections:

- Solution architecture
- Getting started
- Explore the apps
- Next steps

## Introduction

We will cover a typical production use case in this tutorial. In this imaginary, yet realistic factory setup, we have a mobile app that creates production orders, a machine which can start and finish those orders and finally a dashboard app which can display informative production data.
