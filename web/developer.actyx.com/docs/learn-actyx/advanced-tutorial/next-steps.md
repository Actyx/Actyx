At this point, you have run a simplified example of a solution based on 3 ActyxOS apps, and inspected the code of the apps. If you want to continue working with this example project, here are a few ideas:

- **Adapt the solution:** Introduce new data fields, e.g. `Customer`, for an order to be displayed on the dashboard

- **Develop another app:** Develop a fourth app that lets you start and finish orders through a UI (=webview app) instead of a machine connector

- **package the apps and deploy them to actual devices:** Check our guide for [building](/docs/os/guides/building-apps) and [running apps](/docs/os/guides/running-apps)
