Write a connector app to connect with external software systems.

_Connector apps_ are a type of ActyxOS app, whose purpose is to connect with equipment or software outside of the ActyxOS swarm.

As shown above, integrating a software system means writing a connector app that uses the network to communicate with an interface provided by the external system. Given the breadth of enterprise software systems, there are a multitude of different interface types and methods, including:

- File-based data exchange
- SOAP or REST HTTP APIs
- Custom TCP/IP-level interfaces

:::note Using Node-RED
[Node-RED](https://nodered.org/) is a tool that allows you graphically construct data flows. It can be quite useful for such scenarios. Node-Red also provides several protocol-specific connector nodes (e.g. SMB) out-of-the-box.

:::note Virtual machines as edge devices
External software systems often run in virtualized environments. This means that it often makes sense to run ActyxOS and your connector app on a virtual edge device itself, as close as possible to the system you are integrating with. Check out the [Which edge devices does ActyxOS support?](supported-edge-devices.md) FAQ.
