<h2>Installing and running ActyxOS</h2>

ActyxOS on Docker is published on [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/r/actyx/os).
To download and run the latest version execute one of the following commands.

<h3>Production Mode</h3>

<h4>Windows / macOS</h4>

```text
docker run --name actyxos -it --rm -v actyx-data:/data --privileged -p 4001:4001 -p 4457:4457 actyx/os
```

<h4>Linux</h4>

```text
docker run --name actyxos -it --rm -v actyx-data:/data --privileged --network=host actyx/os
```

<h3>Development Mode</h3>

You need to run ActyxOS in development mode if you want to test an ActyxOS application locally without deploying.
This way all the needed ActyxOS services are also exposed on `localhost` of the host.

<h4>Windows / macOS</h4>

```text
docker run --name actyxos -it --rm -e AX_DEV_MODE=1 -v actyxos-data:/data --privileged -p 4001:4001 -p 4457:4457 -p 127.0.0.1:4243:4243 -p 127.0.0.1:4454:4454 actyx/os
```

<h4>Linux</h4>

```text
docker run --name actyxos -it --rm -e AX_DEV_MODE=1 -v actyxos-data:/data --privileged --network=host actyx/os
```

:::info Publishing docker ports
Since `--network=host` is not supported on Windows and Mac you have to explicitly forward the needed network ports.
This is also true for any ports your apps may want to expose, so you would need to add them to this list.
Please refer to the [Docker Documentation](https://docs.docker.com/) for more information on how to run Docker containers.
:::

After executing one of the above-mentioned commands, you should now see the following in your command line:

```text
Starting ActyxOS
***********************
**** ActyxOS ready ****
***********************
```

Congratulations, you have successfully installed and run ActyxOS on Docker! ðŸŽ‰

<h2>Stopping ActyxOS</h2>

In order to stop ActyxOS on Docker, go to your command line and type in `docker stop actyxos` or press `^C` (`ctrl + C`) on your keyboard.
After a couple of seconds, ActyxOS will be stopped.
