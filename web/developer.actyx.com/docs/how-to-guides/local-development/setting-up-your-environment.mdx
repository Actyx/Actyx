Building solutions on Actyx requires a very basic toolkit which will â€” once properly set-up â€” help you to automate factory workflows efficiently on the Actyx low-code platform.
If you are new to this, don't worry! This guide will go through each step that is required for you to get started and build your first application.
Whatever common operating system you are using, this article will give you what you need to be able to start developing.
You will need to install and set up three things:

1. Node.js
2. npm
3. VS Code

## Node.js & npm

Node.js is an open-source, asynchronous, event-driven JavaScript runtime environment.
All it means is that it enables you to run Javascript code outside a web browser, locally on your computer.
So letâ€™s go ahead and download and install Node.js.
You can download Node [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).
We recommend you download the latest long-term support (LTS) version to get the latest **most stable** Node.js features.
Simply choose your development platform (Windows, macOS or Linux) and go through the installation process.

Now, let's look at the Node Package Manager (npm).
Luckily, npm â€” being the **Node** package manager â€“ is already included in the `Node.js` installer, so it should be installed onto your machine once you finished the `Node.js` installation process.  
You know whether everything worked out, by opening your command line and typing `node --version` and `npm --version` respectively.
You should see something like the following:

```text
$ node --version
v14.15.1

$ npm --version
6.14.8
```

Done? Great! Two down, one to go ðŸ’ª.

## Visual Studio Code

Let's now install Visual Studio Code.
Now, this is certainly not a _must_.
You can of course use any code editor you like.
However, VS Code has established itself as one of the most popular editors since it combines the simplicity of a source code editor with powerful developer tooling, like code completion, debugging tools and a large variety of extensions.
