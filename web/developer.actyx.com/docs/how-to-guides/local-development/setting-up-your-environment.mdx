Building solutions on Actyx requires a very basic toolkit which will â€” once properly set-up â€” help you to automate factory workflows efficiently on the Actyx low-code platform.
If you are new to this, don't worry!
This guide will go through each step that is required for you to get started and build your first application.
You will need to install and set up three things:

1. Node.js
2. npm
3. VS Code

## Node.js & npm

Node.js is an open-source, asynchronous, event-driven JavaScript runtime environment.
All it means is that it enables you to run Javascript code outside a web browser, locally on your computer.
So letâ€™s go ahead and download and install Node.js.
You can download Node [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).
We recommend you download the latest long-term support (LTS) version to get the latest **most stable** Node.js features.
Simply choose your development platform (Windows, macOS or Linux) and go through the installation process.

Now, let's look at the Node Package Manager (npm).
Luckily, npm â€” being the **Node** package manager â€“ is already included in the `Node.js` installer, so it should be installed onto your machine once you finished the `Node.js` installation process.  
You know whether everything worked out, by opening your command line and typing `node --version` and `npm --version` respectively.
You should see something like the following:

```text
$ node --version
v14.15.1

$ npm --version
6.14.8
```

Done? Great! Two down, one to go ðŸ’ª.

## Visual Studio Code

Let's now install Visual Studio Code.
Now, this is certainly not a _must_.
You can of course use any code editor you like.
However, VS Code has established itself as one of the most popular editors since for combining the simplicity of a source code editor with powerful developer tooling, like code completion, debugging tools and a large variety of extensions.
To install VS Code, simply go to [this website](https://code.visualstudio.com/download), download the right package for your operating system and follow the installation instructions.

### Typescript Compiler

Our programming framework Actyx Pond, as well as our SDK, and all of our example projects are written in Typescript.
Therefore, to make your life with Actyx _even easier_, we highly recommend you download the [Typescript compiler](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/typescript) for VS Code.
To do this, simply run the following command from your command line:

```text
npm install -g typescript
```

To check your installed version, you can execute

```text
tsc --version
```

### VS Code Extensions

Without extensions, VS Code is just another code editor.
Therefore, we recommend you download the four following extensions that will support you in your work.

1. [Actyx Pond](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Actyx.actyx-pond) extension for effectively working with fishes
2. [ESLint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint) extension for live source code linting

## Final Remarks

You are all set! ðŸŽ‰
Now, everything that is left is familiarising yourself with our programming framework Actyx Pond and starting to write your first applications.
