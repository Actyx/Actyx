When developing on the Actyx low-code platform, the way you package your apps is up to you.
Depenging on the use-case, the kind of application and the operating system it will run on eventually, the form factor and the way to get to it may vary.
The commonality however is, that you need to package a project built with Javascript/Typescript, HTML and CSS into something that the devices you want to use can run.

Actyx today supports Android as the mobile OS platform, so your Actyx app needs to eventually be an [Android application package (apk)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_application_package).
This guide will walk you through a couple of options you have when packaging your apps for Android.
