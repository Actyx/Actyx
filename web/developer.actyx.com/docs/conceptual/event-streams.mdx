<!-- TODO:

Probably can take quite some content from the old one: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Actyx/Cosmos/cb1be4c7ea86e62c95e50a0db794b229429fe032/web/developer.actyx.com/docs/os/guides/event-streams.md?token=AFUQA4ZB64C36BPFC4CYELTAXCGN2

Session ID:
- Clarify what "resuming" a session implies.
- What if the user makes to requests with same session ID but different subscription? -> hash both
- Can't we keep this stateless by the client keeping track of the offsets and resume on error? We have to keep track of session ID already.
- What about expiration? How do we to communicate that to the client?

timeTravel events:
  - could not reproduce
  - need to check whether output is correct
  - question: how do I get one of these?

Node ID:
- needs more explanation. could be moved to the event stream guide, which needs updating reg. the source id conversion.

Stream ID:
- clarify what it is, what it is for etc.
