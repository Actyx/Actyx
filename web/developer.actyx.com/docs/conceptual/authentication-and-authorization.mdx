This guide explains authentication and authorization with Actyx.
There are three concepts to consider:

1. Developer authorization with a developer certificate
2. App authentication using a signed app manifest
3. App authorization with app license keys

This conceptual guide explains how these three concepts work together and what you need to keep in mind.

:::info working with Actyx during development
Note that this guide only is relevant for you if you are preparing an app to run in production.
If you simply want to try out Actyx and use the APIs for development purposes only, please use an app ID starting with `com.example.`
The rest will be taken care of by Actyx.
:::

## Developer authorization

All events emitted by an app are linked to the app ID stored in its app manifest, thus creating a reserved namespace.
This means that as a developer you need to be authorized to develop apps that use said reserved namespace.
This is where you need an Actyx developer certificate.
It is generated by Actyx and can be obtained [by filling out this form](https://oliver454918.typeform.com/to/gqSIzIwm).

:::info
For a detailed guide on how to obtain a your certificate, please refer to our how-to guides [obtaining a developer certificate](../how-to/user-auth/get-developer-certificate.mdx).

Note that the app ID is linked to the domain name of your work email address used for generating the developer certificate and must be written in reverse domain name notation.
For example, if your work email address is alex@awesome-si.com, your app ID needs to always start with `com.awesome-si.`.
After that, you then typically add the name of your app, e.g. `com.awesome-si.dashboard-app`.

Once you have received your developer certificate, please make sure to save it in a secure location on your device as you will need to provide the path to your certificate every time you want to sign an app manifest.
As this certificate is linked to the domain of your e-mail address, you may also share the certificate with your colleagues to allow them to use it for app signing as well.

## App Authentication

For your application to access the Actyx APIs, you need to authenticate your app with the node.
This is done by providing the node with a signed manifest using the [Auth API](../reference/auth-api.mdx) or our SDK.
That way, the events that are emitted by the signed app can be correctly associated with its app ID.
This also guarantees that events with that app ID cannot be published by other apps with different app IDs.

You can sign your manifest by providing the CLI or the Node Manager with the path to your developer certificate and the path to your manifest.

In return for a valid, signed manifest you will receive an auth token.
This token must then be used with every HTTP request to the [Events API](../reference/events-api.mdx).

:::info
For a detailed guide on how to sign a manifest or authenticate an app, please refer to our how-to guides on [app signing](../how-to/app-auth/sign-app-manifest.mdx) and [app authentication](../how-to/app-auth/authenticate-with-app-manifest.mdx).

## App Authorization

:::info No need to license
If you are working with an Actyx node in development, apps running on that node do not need to be licensed.
In that case, please configure your node to be in `development`:

```json title="Node settings example"
...
"licensing": {
    "node": "development"
}
...
```

If your node is licensed and running in production, all apps need to be licensed.
Unauthorized apps that run on nodes in production will not receive an auth token from the [Auth API](../reference/auth-api.mdx).
:::

Apart from the app manifest to authenticate your app, apps that run in production need to be additionally authorized with a valid app license key.
Please get in touch with your contact at Actyx or fill out [this form](https://www.actyx.com/contact) for buying app licenses.
Once you have obtained an app license, simply [add the license key to the settings](../how-to/app-auth/manage-authorized-apps.mdx) on the node on which you want to run the application.
