Actyx is a platform for building highly resilient software systems distributed across a swarm of networked devices. Specifically you can:

1. Implement business logic as twins
1. Include your twins in apps running on devices
1. Forget about the network and data persistence

Actyx enables a completely decentralized architecture that allows you to **build apps that always runs**. Your apps always run because they run locally on the device and only interact with the locally running Actyx software.
