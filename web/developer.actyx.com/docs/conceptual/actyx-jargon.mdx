Actyx has lots of amazing features that make factory automation easier. But, like any technology, that means there is some jargon that can be confusing to newcomers.
So let's define the basics so you find your way around our documentation.

### Actyx

Actyx is a piece of software that you deploy to your device. It is packaged in various formats, e.g. as a Linux binary or as an Android APK â€” check out our reference documentation for supported operating systems and architectures to find out more.

### Node

An Actyx node is a device that runs Actyx. The device can be physical, e.g. a tablet, or virtual, e.g. a virtual machine. There is one special type of node, see [bootstrap node](#bootstrap-node) below.

### Swarm

An Actyx swarm is a group of Actyx nodes that are configured with the same Swarm Key. Nodes inside a swarm are connected to each other and exchange events.

### Bootstrap node

A boostrap node is an Actyx node like any other with one exception: It does not store or distribute events. It only connects to other nodes and its purpose is to serve as a directory for all nodes that form a swarm. When a new node connects to the bootstrap node, it gets a list of all other nodes in the swarm which facilitates peer discovery.

### App

An app is a piece of software that runs on a device that also runs Actyx. On that device, the app interacts locally with Actyx through Actyx's APIs. The packaging of the app (e.g. as a Docker container or Android APK) depends on the device it is running on.

### Pond

The Actyx Pond is a programming framework for writing apps for Actyx. It is available on [npm](http://npmjs.com/package/@actyx/pond). Check out our [how-to guides](../how-to/actyx-pond/introduction.mdx) for more information.

### Fish

A fish is a concept of the Actyx Pond. It is the main programming unit used when writing apps with the Actyx Pond. Check out our [how-to guides](../how-to/actyx-pond/introduction.mdx) for more information.
