## Networking Requirements

| Device                                                                                                                                                               | LAN/WLAN                                                                                                                                                                                 |

It is **not** supported to put firewalls between devices of the same swarm.
Wherever possible, devices should be placed within one broadcast domain.
Placing devices of the same swarm across different broadcast domains requires [manually configuring initial peers](../how-to/swarms/connect-nodes.mdx) and configuring communication between these broadcast domains accordingly.

:::info Using non-standard ports
Apart from the mDNS parameters, the three used TCP ports can be freely configured when starting Actyx.
The command line options for these are

- `--bind-swarm` for the inter-node data transfer port (default: 4001)
- `--bind-api` for the HTTP API used by applications (default: 4454)
- `--bind-admin` for the admin port used by the Node Manager and Actyx CLI (default: 4458)

See also `actyx --help` for more details.

## Performance

A lot of different factors play into performance of Actyx and your apps. Assuming a standard network setup, rugged tablets or other devices with relatively low computing power, and a standard factory use case, these are approximate limits:

| Type            | Performance                                                  |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Latency         | below 200 ms, not guaranteed as dependent on several factors |
| No. of nodes    | max. 100 nodes                                               |
| Event data rate | ~1 event per node per 10 seconds                             |

Please refer to the [performance and limits](../conceptual/performance-and-limits.mdx) page for more detailed information, also regarding typical disk usage etc.

The following list shows the factors that influence performance. **Please note that these are not requirements, but assumptions made for the above performance characteristics:**

| Factor                    | Assumption                                                                                |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| LAN setup and latency     | standard / WiFi                                                                           |
| App runtimes              | Webview (Node.js) and Docker                                                              |
| Devices                   | Rugged tablets or other devices with relatively low computing power (e.g. Raspberry Pi 3) |
| Device CPU                | 1-2 GHz, x86/arm architecture                                                             |
| Device RAM                | 1-4 GB                                                                                    |
| Programming language      | Typescript                                                                                |
| Business logic complexity | Standard factory use case, production data and machine data acquisition                   |

:::info Assumptions do not fit your use case?
The limits regarding performance and disk space described on this page are only true within the circumstances outlined above. If one of these factors changes, the limits for your solution might change. If you are looking for guidance on a specific use case, please refer to our [conceptual guide](../conceptual/performance-and-limits.mdx) or contact us.

## Node Settings Schema

Which settings are available and which values they may have is defined in the so-called Actyx **Node Setting Schema**.
The most recent version thereof is available for download at:

[https://developer.actyx.com/schemas/node-settings.schema.json](pathname:///schemas/node-settings.schema.json)

The `admin` section of the settings holds a list of [authorized users](../how-to/user-auth/manage-authorized-users.mdx), represented by their public keys (you can find yours in your O/S-specific user profile folder under `actyx/keys/users/id.pub`).
If you need to access a node that doesn’t accept your key, but you have administrator access to the (virtual) device it is running on, then you may use [`ax users add-key`](../reference/cli/users/add-key.md) to get yourself in — make sure to stop Actyx before doing this.
The `displayName` property is shown in the Node Manager or `ax nodes inspect` etc., so it is useful to set it to some short string that helps you identify the node.
You can change the `/admin/logLevels/node` setting to adjust the logging output verbosity at runtime; valid values are DEBUG, INFO, WARN, or ERROR.

The `/api/events/readOnly` setting controls whether the node will send events to the rest of the swarm.
Its main use is to create a “silent observer” that you use to test new app versions without risking to taint the swarm with development or test events.

The `licensing` section is described in [licensing apps](../how-to/licensing/license-apps.mdx).

In the `swarm` section you can fine-tune the networking behavior of Actyx:

- **announceAddresses:** an array of addresses allows you to declare IP addresses under which the node is reachable, but that are not listen addresses.
  This is frequently necessary when running Actyx inside a Docker container, see [configuring the `announceAddresses` setting](../how-to/swarms/configure-announced-addresses.mdx).

- **bitswapTimeout:** maximal wait time for a data request sent to another swarm node.
  You may need to increase this on very slow networks if you regularly see bitswap timeout warnings in the logs.

- **blockCacheCount:** the number of IPFS data blocks kept in the local `actyx-data` folder for the current topic.
  All swarm event data blocks and pinned files will be kept regardless of this setting, only voluntarily cached blocks can be evicted.

- **blockCacheSize:** the size in bytes up to which data blocks are kept in the local `actyx-data` folder for the current topic.
  The same restriction applies as for blocks in that events and pinned files are not eligible for eviction, so the cache may grow larger.

- **blockGcInterval:** the interval at which eligible data are evicted from the local `actyx-data` folder for the current topic.
  There should be no need to change this.

- **branchCacheSize:** cache size in bytes for those IPFS blocks that contain event stream metadata.
  You may need to increase this in situations where many devices have been producing events for a long time:
  if this cache becomes too small, application query performance will drastically decline.

- **initialPeers:** an array of addresses of the form `/ip4/<IP address>/tcp/<port>/p2p/<PeerId>` to which this node shall [immediately try to connect](../how-to/swarms/connect-nodes.mdx).

- **mdns:** flag with which usage of the [mDNS protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multicast_DNS) for peer discovery can be disabled.

- **pingTimeout:** Each connection to another Actyx node is continually monitored via messages sent over that TCP connection (they are called “ping”, but have nothing to do with the `ping` network tool).
  When three successive pings have not been answered within the allotted timeout, the connection is closed and will be re-established.
  You may need to increase this on very slow networks if you regularly see ping timeout warnings in the logs.

- **swarmKey:** an additional layer of encryption between Actyx nodes that allows you to separate swarm so that they cannot connect to each other.
  See [the guide on swarm keys](../how-to/swarms/setup-swarm.mdx#create-a-swarm-key).

- **topic:** a logical separation of nodes within the same swarm — events can only be replicated within the same topic, and each node can only be part of one topic.
  This is mainly useful for effectively erasing all events within a swarm by switching all nodes to a new topic.
  The old events will still be in the `actyx-data` folder, you can access them by switching a node back to the old topic; there will be no interference between old and new topic.

The `eventRouting` section (added in version 2.16) is divided in two subsections - `routes` and `streams`.

The `routes` section is an array of patterns, it allows the administrator to create stream routes based on tag expressions (i.e. most expressions that can be used after `FROM`):
- **from:** the tag expression used to filter events. For example, the expression `'logs:info' | 'logs:debug'` will match all events containing either the `logs:info` or `logs:debug` tags.
- **into:** the name of stream to place the matching events into.

:::warning Route order matters!
Event matching is done from top to bottom, thus, if you declare the following routes:
```yaml
routes:
  - from: "'logs:info' | 'logs:debug'"
    into: "info_or_debug"
  - from: "'logs:info'"
    into: "info"
```
All events tagged will be placed in the `info_or_debug` stream, not making it into the `info` stream.
:::

:::info Migration from pre-2.15 versions
Migration is done automatically, if you have an existing node, the routes for the existing Actyx streams will be performed automatically.
Similarly, if you do not have an `eventRouting` configuration in place, when launching a new node, the same streams (`discovery`, `metrics`, `files`) will be created.
:::

The `streams` section is an object, mapping stream names to policies, it allows the administrator to configure retention policies for the streams declared in `routes`, these policies are kept on a best effort basis:
- **maxEvents:** the maximum number of most recent events to keep. For example, if you set `maxEvents` to 1000 and currently have 1024 events store, the oldest 24 events will be deleted.
- **maxSize:** the size beyond which streams will start being pruned. For example, if you set `maxSize` to `1GB` and your stream occupies `1500MB` the oldest events will be removed until `1GB` is reached again.
This setting supports the following units - `B` (Bytes), `kB` (Kilobytes), `KiB` (Kibibytes), `MB` (Megabytes), `MiB` (Mebibytes), `GB` (Gigabytes) or `GiB` (Gibibytes).
- **maxAge:** the age beyond which events will start being removed. For example if you set this setting to `1h`, all events older than 1 hour at the time of pruning will be removed.
This setting supports the following units: `s` (seconds), `m` (minutes), `h` (hours), `d` (days) or `w` (weeks).

:::caution
The `default` stream **does not** support retention policies.
The `streams` section will not create a new stream, and will throw a warning instead.
:::

Here's an example of the complete configuration for the `eventRouting`:

```yaml
eventRouting:
  routes:
    - from: "'logs:warn'"
      into: logs_warnings
    - from: "'logs:trace' | 'logs:debug'"
      into: logs_debug
    - from: "logs"
      into: logs
  streams:
    logs_debug:
      maxAge: 1d
      maxSize: 100MB
```
