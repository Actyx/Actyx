## Node Settings Schema

ActyxOS needs a number of settings to be defined in order to work, and provides optional settings that you can use to configure your nodes' behavior.
Which settings are available and which values they may have is defined in the so-called ActyxOS **Node Setting Schema**.
The most recent version thereof is available for download at:

[https://developer.actyx.com/schemas/os/node-settings.schema.json](pathname:///schemas/os/node-settings.schema.json)

An ActyxOS node always comes with default settings that ensure an Actyx node is operational after installation.
These default values are also defined in the node settings schema but can be overwritten anytime.

Here are a couple of nodes settings and their corresponding schema:

| Setting      | Type     | Permitted values       | Default value  |
| ------------ | -------- | ---------------------- | -------------- |
| Display name | `string` | _any non empty string_ | "Default Node" |

This definition in the node settings schema:

```json
"displayName": {
          "$ref": "#/definitions/Basic/NonEmptyString",
          "default": "Default Node"
},
```

| Setting         | Type    | Permitted values | Default value |
| --------------- | ------- | ---------------- | ------------- |
| Bootstrap Nodes | `array` | _MultiAddr_      | []            |

This definition in the node settings schema:

```json
"bootstrapNodes": {
          "type": "array",
          "items": {
            "$ref": "#/definitions/Basic/MultiAddr"
          },
          "default": [],
          "uniqueItems": true,
          "description": "Addresses of peers to initially connect for bootstrapping. These must be multiaddresses containing a peer id. E.g. /dns4/demo-bootstrap.actyx.net/tcp/4001/p2p/QmUD1mA3Y8qSQB34HmgSNcxDss72UHW2kzQy7RdVstN2hH"
        },
```

Here is an example of schema-compliant node settings:

```yaml
general:
  displayName: My Node
  swarmKey: 4904199ec5e74cc5871cad1ddad4b9e636c9dfcc55269d954dd4048e336b5433
  bootstrapNodes:
