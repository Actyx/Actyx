This is the reference documentation for the **Events API**.
If you run into questions while going through the document, we recommend reading the [conceptual guide](../conceptual/event-streams) on event streams to get a more holistic understanding of how the Events API works.

The Events API allows you to

- [get information about known offsets](#get-information-about-known-offsets),
- [publish events](#publish-events)
- [query event streams](#query-event-streams),
- [subscribe to event streams](#subscribe-to-event-streams), and
- [subscribe to event streams monotonically](#subscribe-to-event-streams-monotonically)

It is reachable at the following base URI: `http://localhost:4454/api/v2/events`.

:::info Pretty printed JSON
JSON used in the examples below is pretty-printed with [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/). This is only to make it more readable here.
In reality, the Events API does not return pretty-printed JSON but the usual compact JSON you know from any other service.
:::

## Prerequisites

Communication with the Events API needs to be authenticated.
Therefore an auth token which is associated with the requesting app needs to be retrieved from the Auth API[./auth-api].
This token then needs to be passed in the `Authorization` header with every request to the Events API.
In the following examples we will use the `$AUTH_TOKEN` environment variable which can be initialized with

```bash
export AUTH_TOKEN="$(curl -s localhost:4454/api/v2/auth -d'{"appId": "com.example.app","displayName": "Example App","version": "1.0"}' -H "Content-Type: application/json" | jq -r '.token')"
```

While the following examples use [cURL](https://curl.se/), other command-line or graphical tools (e.g. [Postman](https://www.postman.com/product/api-client/)) would work as well.

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs'
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem'

:::info Examples to follow along
The sections below are split into reference documentation and usage examples.
The examples are made in such a way that you can simply copy and paste the commands into your terminal.
Please note that to follow along, you need to replace the node and stream IDs from the examples with yours.
:::

## Get information about known offsets

You can get information from the Events API about known offsets, i.e. what the API believes to be the latest offset for each stream.
This request returns the currently validated `present` as observed by this node, meaning that all events described by this offset map are available for querying.

It further returns a map in `toReplicate`, which describes the number of events that are available in the swarm and should eventually become available on this local node.
Fully replicated streams are omitted from this map.

Take a look at the [event streams guide](../conceptual/event-streams) to learn more about the role of offsets.

## Query event streams

You can query the Events API for bounded sets of events in one or more event streams.

<Tabs
  groupId="content"
  defaultValue={"ref"}
  values={[
    { label: 'Reference', value: 'ref' },
    { label: 'Example', value: 'ex' },
  ]}

<TabItem value="ref">


### Request

- Endpoint: `http://localhost:4454/api/v2/events/query`
- HTTP method: `POST`
- HTTP headers:
  - `Authorization`, see [Prerequisites](#prerequisites)
  - (optional) `Content-Type`, must be `application/json`, default: `application/json`
  - (optional) `Accept`, must be `application/x-ndjson`, default: `application/x-ndjson`

The request body must contain a JSON object with the following structure:

```json
{
  "query": "<string: tag query, e.g. «FROM 'tag-01' & 'tag-02'»>",
  "order": "<string: 'asc' | 'desc' | 'stream-asc'>",
  "upperBound": {
    "<string: stream ID>": "<integer: inclusive-upper-bound, e.g. 49>",
    "<string: stream ID>": "<integer: inclusive-upper-bound, e.g. 101>"
  },
  "lowerBound": {
    "<string: stream ID>": "<integer: exclusive-lower-bound, e.g. 34>",
    "<string: stream ID>": "<integer: exclusive-lower-bound, e.g. -1>"
  }
}
```

You use the request body to specify the details of your request as documented in the following.

#### Optional: Lower bound for offsets (`lowerBound`)

The `lowerBound` object specifies the lower bound offset for each stream with the numbers being **exclusive**,
i.e. a `lowerBound` specification of `34` means the Events API will return events with offsets `> 34`.

The `lowerBound` is optional.
If none is set for one, multiple or all subscribed streams, the Events API will assume no lower bound.

#### Optional: Upper bounds for offsets (`upperBound`)

The `upperBound` object specifies the upper bound offset for each stream with the numbers being **inclusive**.
i.e. an `upperBound` specification of `34` means the Events API will return events with offsets `<= 34`.
If none is set, the response stream will contain all events that were known to the system at the time of query.
Otherwise the Events API will only return events from streams that are specified.

#### Required: Query (`query`)

The `query` field specifies an [AQL](/docs/reference/aql) query that defines how events should be filtered and/or transformed.

#### Required: Ordering (`order`)

The `order` object specifies in which order the events should be returned to the caller. There are three options, one of which must be specified:

1. `asc`: ascending order according to events' [lamport timestamp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamport_timestamps)
2. `desc`: descending order according to events' lamport timestamp
3. `stream-asc`: ascending order according to events' lamport timestamp per stream, with no inter-stream ordering guarantees.

:::info Event order criteria
Please note that for identical Lamport timestamps the stream ID is taken into account as a secondary sort criterion for event ordering.
:::

### Response

- HTTP headers:
  - `Content-Type` is `application/x-ndjson`
  - `Transfer-Encoding` is `chunked`

The response will be in the [Newline Delimited JSON format](http://ndjson.org/) with the following formats:

#### Response type `event`

```json
{
  "type": "event",
  "lamport": "<integer>",
  "stream": "<string: stream ID>",
  "offset": "<integer>",
  "timestamp": "<integer: unix epoch in microseconds>",
  "tags": "<string[]: tags>",
  "appId": "<string>",
  "payload": "<object>"
}
```

#### Response type `offsets`

```json
{
  "type": "offsets",
  "offsets": {
    "<string: stream ID>": "<integer: event offset, e.g. 49>",
    "<string: stream ID>": "<integer: event offset, e.g. 101>"
  }
}
```

#### Response type `diagnostics`

```json
{
  "type": "diagnostic",
  "severity": "<string: 'warning' or 'error'>",
  "message": "<string>"
}
```

:::info Response types
This is just a subset of possible response types. Clients should be prepared to handle (or ignore)
responses with a value of `type` not specified above.
:::

If an error is encountered while processing the stream of events, the stream will terminate with a final error JSON object with the following structure:

```json
{
  "code": "<string: error code>",
  "message": "<string: error message>"
}
```

  "tags": ["tag-01", "tag-02"],
  "appId": "com.example.app",
  "payload": {
    "value": 2
  }
}
```

:::info
Note that in order for the JSON to be parsed correctly, we need to use a backslash `\` before the double quotes in the tag expression.
Alternatively, you could save the JSON payload to a file called `query.json`

```json title="query.json"
{
  "query": "FROM 'tag-01' & ('tag-02' | 'tag-03')",
  "order": "desc",
  "lowerBound": {
    "1g1UOqdpvBB1KHsGWGZiK3Vi8MYGDZZ1oylpOajUk.s-2": 34
  },
  "upperBound": {
    "1g1UOqdpvBB1KHsGWGZiK3Vi8MYGDZZ1oylpOajUk.s-2": 57
  }
}
```

and use it in the HTTP request like so:

```text title="Request with file as payload"
curl \
    -s -X "POST" \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer $AUTH_TOKEN" \
    -d @query.json \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -H "Accept: application/x-ndjson" \
    http://localhost:4454/api/v2/events/query | jq .
```

## Subscribe to event streams monotonically

You can use the Events API to subscribe to event streams with the guarantee that whenever the service learns about events that need to be sorted earlier than an event that has already been delivered the stream ends with a _time travel_ message.

<Tabs
  groupId="content"
  defaultValue={"ref"}
  values={[
    { label: 'Reference', value: 'ref' },

### Request

- Endpoint: `http://localhost:4454/api/v2/events/subscribe_monotonic`
- HTTP method: `POST`
- HTTP headers:
  - `Authorization`, see [Prerequisites](#prerequisites)
  - (optional) `Content-Type`, must be `application/json`, default: `application/json`
  - (optional) `Accept`, must be `application/x-ndjson`, default: `application/x-ndjson`

The request body must contain a JSON object with the following structure:

```json
{
  "session": "<string: user supplied session ID>",
  "query": "<string: tag query, e.g. «FROM 'tag1' & 'tag2'»>",
  "lowerBound": {
    "<string: stream ID>": "<integer: exclusive-lower-bound, e.g. 34>",
    "<string: stream ID>": "<integer: exclusive-lower-bound, e.g. -1>"
  }
}
```

You use the request body to specify additional details of your request as documented in the following:

#### Required: Session ID (`session`)

The session identifier is chosen by the client and must be used consistently by the client to resume an earlier session.
For fishes this will usually be the fish id.

:::info
If the `query` changes, a new session will be created regardless of the existence of a session with the same ID.
:::

#### Required: Query (`query`)

The `query` field specifies an [AQL](/docs/reference/aql) query that defines how events should be filtered and/or transformed.

#### Optional: Lower bound for offsets (`lowerBound`)

The `lowerBound` object specifies the lower bound offset for each stream with the numbers being
**exclusive**, i.e. a `lowerBound` specification of `34` means the Events API will return events with offsets `> 34`.

The `lowerBound` field is optional. If none is set for any of the subscribed streams,
the Events API will assume a lower bound offset of `-1`, i.e. the beginning.

  }
}

#### Response type `timeTravel`

In case the service learns about events that need to be sorted earlier than an event that has already been delivered, an event of this type is emitted and the stream is closed.

```json
