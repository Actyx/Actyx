This tutorial that doesn't assume any existing knowledge of the Actyx Platform.

## Before we start

We are going to build a small chat app during this tutorial. **You might be tempted to skip it because you are not building chats in real-life — give it a chance.** The techniques that you will learn in this tutorial are fundamental to building any app on the Actyx platform, and mastering them will give you a deep understanding of the platform.

The tutorial is divided into several sections:

- Setup for the Tutorial will give you a starting point to follow the tutorial.
- Overview will teach you the fundamentals of Actyx: nodes, fishes, and events.
- Completing the chat will teach you the most common techniques in Actyx development.
- Adding time travel will give you a deeper insight into the unique strengths of Actyx.

You don’t have to complete all of the sections at once to get the value out of this tutorial. Try to get as far as you can — even if it’s one or two sections.

### What are we building?

In this tutorial we will show you how to build a decentralized chat app. The result will be an app that you can run on your phone (or your computer) and that will look something like this:

### Prerequisites

We’ll assume that you have some familiarity with HTML, CSS and Typescript, but you should be able to follow along even if you’re coming from a different programming language. We’ll also assume that you’re familiar with programming concepts like functions, objects and arrays.


:::info Typescript in 5 minutes
If you need to review Typescript, we recommend reading [this guide](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/typescript-in-5-minutes.html).

The best way to experience this tutorial — and decentralized computing — is using multiple devices. If you don't have two Android devices at hand, you can also use your laptop and one Android device. You will have to make sure that both of these devices are connected to the same Wifi.

:::warning mDNS and Client Isolation
If you have disabled mDNS in your network, you will have to ensure your devices can initially connect to the internet. If you have enable Client Isolation, this tutorial will not work.
