title: How many devices can I use in a swarm?

It depends, but 100 devices should work without issues.

The amount of devices you can reliably run in a single ActyxOS swarm depends on a large number of factors, including the local-area network setup, the devices themselves and the apps running on them.

Given current production systems and internal benchmarks, 100 devices should work without any issues.
