Each ActyxOS node provides a set of APIs that are described on the following pages:

- the [Event Service](event-service.md)
- the [Blob Service](blob-service.md) (INTERNAL ALPHA)
- the [Console Service](console-service.md)

In addition, there are the [node settings schema](node-settings-schema.md) and the [app manifest schema](app-manifest-schema.md).
