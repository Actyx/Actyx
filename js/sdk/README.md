# Actyx SDK

A TypeScript SDK for writing distributed apps deployed on peer-to-peer networks, without any servers. 

This is made possible by being based on [Actyx](https://www.actyx.com/platform). Please visit also the [documentation](https://developer.actyx.com/docs/pond/getting-started) for how to get started.

## Key features

- **Distributed Event-Sourcing** architecture for great information replication facilities and declarative information consumption

- **Partition Tolerance** built into the core by offering an eventually consistent programming model for arbitrary business logic

- **Eventual Consistency made easy** by using an innovative time-travel algorithm integrated with performance optimizations like snapshots for swift recovery after restart

## IDE setup

The recommended IDE for developing on Actyx is [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

### Recommended plugins
- [ESLint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint) for live source code linting
