 * It is probably a user error to ask for an unbounded set of sources or for events with higher PSN than in the 'present'.
 *
 * The returned event chunks can contain events from multiple sources. If the sort order is unsorted, we guarantee
 * that chunks will be sorted by ascending psn for each source.
 *
 * Looking for a semantic snapshot can be accomplished by getting events in reverse event key order and aborting the
 * iteration as soon as a semantic snapshot is found.
 *
 * Depending on latency between pond and store the store will traverse into the past a bit further than needed, but
 * given that store and pond are usually on the same machine this won't be that bad, and in any case this is perferable
 * to needing a way of sending a javascript predicate to the store.

 * The returned event chunks can contain events from multiple sources. If the sort order is unsorted, we guarantee

 *
 * A sort order of anything else but unsorted mostly makes sense if either fromPsnsExcluding or toPsnsIncluding
 * constrains the set of sources to a finite set. When asking for sorted events for an infinite set of sources,
 * new sources will be included as they become known, but in a manner that the overall stream still remains sorted.
 * That is, for a new source, all its events older than the latest event emitted by this stream will NOT BE INCLUDED.
 *
 * When having a finite set of sources, sorting by event key can be used to get events in such a way that there
 * will be no time travel. Progress of the stream will be blocked as long as at least 1 source is disconnected.
 *
 * Getting events up to a maximum event key can be achieved for a finite set of sources by specifying sort by
 * event key and aborting as soon as the desired event key is reached.
