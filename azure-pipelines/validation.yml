# This file configures how azure pipelines are being run on our two CI boxes ci-0.actyx.net and ci-2.actyx.net
#
# CI jobs run on these machines as user ubuntu.
# Tools and headers that are needed for the build can be added by logging into both CI servers and installing them
# using `sudo apt install`.
# Currently used tools that are not installed during make prepare are: jq, protoc, libssl-dev, build-essential.
#
# Each machine provides a number of azure pipelines workers, currently 12. These can be accessed with the pool Native.
#
# The workers are started as systemd services, configured in `/etc/systemd/system/vsts-agent.*.service`
# The working directory is a subdirectory of `/ubuntu/home`, e.g. `/ubunutu/home/agents/agent-0`
# Each job gets a numbered directory in `_work/`, e.g. `/home/ubuntu/agents/agent-0/_work/4`
# Source is checked out into a subdirectory called s, e.g. `/home/ubuntu/agents/agent-0/_work/4/s`
# The current working directory while exexuting jobs is this directory.
#
# On startup, each agent can be configured by some files in the agent directory, `/home/ubuntu/agents/agent-0/runsvc.sh`
#
# Environment variables are configured in the azure pipeline GUI. Environment variables marked as secret must be
# explicitly imported into jobs in the env section. E.g. AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID: $(SECRET_AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID)
#
# NOTE: We rely on the host to periodically do `docker login` both to DockerHub and GitHub Packages instead of relying
# on Azure Pipelines to do it, since having Pipelines do it introduces a race condition where, if a job fails,
# it logs out from DockerHub. Since we're using host-based agents, this logs out every single running pipeline,
# leading to random failures. All CI hosts have a crontab that logs in to both every hour.
# See https://github.com/Actyx/Cosmos/pull/5138.
