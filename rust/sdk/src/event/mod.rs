/// Events are delivered in this envelope together with their metadata
///
/// # Metadata
///
/// Ordering and equality do not depend on the type of payload: `lamport` and `key.stream`
/// uniquely identify the event and give rise to a total order (first by Lamport timestamp,
/// then by stream ID;  an Actyx node   will never use the same Lamport timestamp
/// more than once).
///
/// The contained Lamport timestamp tracks the causal order of events, which may not
/// always be linked to or consistent with real time, especially when events were produced by devices
/// that were not communicating for some time period. This implies that the wall clock
/// `timestamp` may go backwards when consuming an ordered event stream (this would also
/// be the case due to clock skew between devices).
///
/// > Illustrative example: two groups of nodes are separated from each other for some time
/// period, for example due to traveling through an area without network coverage. Their logical
/// clocks may advance at different speeds because the number of events created in each group
/// may be different. When sorting by Lamport timestamp, the events from the group with the lower
/// event rate will tend to be sorted earlier than the events from the other group, regardless
/// of the wall clock time at which they occurred.
///
/// It is desirable to sort by Lamport timestamps because they provide the correct (intuitive)
/// sort order when nodes are properly communicating, which is the common case. Using device
/// hardware clocks has proven to be quite unreliable because they may jump forward and backward
/// due to human or machine error.
