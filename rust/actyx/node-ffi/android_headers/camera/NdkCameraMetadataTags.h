     * <p>When auto-white balance (AWB) is enabled with ACAMERA_CONTROL_AWB_MODE, this
     * control is overridden by the AWB routine. When AWB is disabled, the
     * application controls how the color mapping is performed.</p>
     * <p>We define the expected processing pipeline below. For consistency
     * across devices, this is always the case with TRANSFORM_MATRIX.</p>
     * <p>When either FAST or HIGH_QUALITY is used, the camera device may
     * do additional processing but ACAMERA_COLOR_CORRECTION_GAINS and
     * ACAMERA_COLOR_CORRECTION_TRANSFORM will still be provided by the
     * camera device (in the results) and be roughly correct.</p>
     * <p>Switching to TRANSFORM_MATRIX and using the data provided from
     * FAST or HIGH_QUALITY will yield a picture with the same white point

     * <p>The expected processing pipeline is as follows:</p>
     * <p><img alt="White balance processing pipeline" src="../images/camera2/metadata/android.colorCorrection.mode/processing_pipeline.png" /></p>
     * <p>The white balance is encoded by two values, a 4-channel white-balance
     * gain vector (applied in the Bayer domain), and a 3x3 color transform
     * matrix (applied after demosaic).</p>
     * <p>The 4-channel white-balance gains are defined as:</p>
     * <pre><code>ACAMERA_COLOR_CORRECTION_GAINS = [ R G_even G_odd B ]
     * </code></pre>
     * <p>where <code>G_even</code> is the gain for green pixels on even rows of the
     * output, and <code>G_odd</code> is the gain for green pixels on the odd rows.
     * These may be identical for a given camera device implementation; if
     * the camera device does not support a separate gain for even/odd green
     * channels, it will use the <code>G_even</code> value, and write <code>G_odd</code> equal to
     * <code>G_even</code> in the output result metadata.</p>
     * <p>The matrices for color transforms are defined as a 9-entry vector:</p>
     * <pre><code>ACAMERA_COLOR_CORRECTION_TRANSFORM = [ I0 I1 I2 I3 I4 I5 I6 I7 I8 ]
     * </code></pre>
     * <p>which define a transform from input sensor colors, <code>P_in = [ r g b ]</code>,
     * to output linear sRGB, <code>P_out = [ r' g' b' ]</code>,</p>
     * <p>with colors as follows:</p>
     * <pre><code>r' = I0r + I1g + I2b
     * g' = I3r + I4g + I5b
     * b' = I6r + I7g + I8b
     * </code></pre>

     * If a precapture metering sequence is already completed, and the camera
     * device has implicitly locked the AE for subsequent still capture, the
     * CANCEL trigger will unlock the AE and return to its initial AE state.</p>
     * <p>The precapture sequence should be triggered before starting a
     * high-quality still capture for final metering decisions to
     * be made, and for firing pre-capture flash pulses to estimate
     * scene brightness and required final capture flash power, when
     * the flash is enabled.</p>
     * <p>Normally, this entry should be set to START for only a
     * single request, and the application should wait until the
     * sequence completes before starting a new one.</p>
     * <p>When a precapture metering sequence is finished, the camera device
     * may lock the auto-exposure routine internally to be able to accurately expose the
     * subsequent still capture image (<code>ACAMERA_CONTROL_CAPTURE_INTENT == STILL_CAPTURE</code>).
     * For this case, the AE may not resume normal scan if no subsequent still capture is
     * submitted. To ensure that the AE routine restarts normal scan, the application should
     * submit a request with <code>ACAMERA_CONTROL_AE_LOCK == true</code>, followed by a request
     * with <code>ACAMERA_CONTROL_AE_LOCK == false</code>, if the application decides not to submit a
     * still capture request after the precapture sequence completes. Alternatively, for
     * API level 23 or newer devices, the CANCEL can be used to unlock the camera device
     * internally locked AE if the application doesn't submit a still capture request after
     * the AE precapture trigger. Note that, the CANCEL was added in API level 23, and must not
     * be used in devices that have earlier API levels.</p>
     * <p>The exact effect of auto-exposure (AE) precapture trigger
     * depends on the current AE mode and state; see
     * ACAMERA_CONTROL_AE_STATE for AE precapture state transition
     * details.</p>
     * <p>On LEGACY-level devices, the precapture trigger is not supported;
     * capturing a high-resolution JPEG image will automatically trigger a
     * precapture sequence before the high-resolution capture, including
     * potentially firing a pre-capture flash.</p>
     * <p>Using the precapture trigger and the auto-focus trigger ACAMERA_CONTROL_AF_TRIGGER
     * simultaneously is allowed. However, since these triggers often require cooperation between
     * the auto-focus and auto-exposure routines (for example, the may need to be enabled for a
     * focus sweep), the camera device may delay acting on a later trigger until the previous
     * trigger has been fully handled. This may lead to longer intervals between the trigger and
     * changes to ACAMERA_CONTROL_AE_STATE indicating the start of the precapture sequence, for
     * example.</p>

     * <p>For devices not supporting ACAMERA_DISTORTION_CORRECTION_MODE control, the coordinate
     * system always follows that of ACAMERA_SENSOR_INFO_ACTIVE_ARRAY_SIZE, with (0,0) being
     * the top-left pixel in the active pixel array, and
     * (ACAMERA_SENSOR_INFO_ACTIVE_ARRAY_SIZE.width - 1,
     * ACAMERA_SENSOR_INFO_ACTIVE_ARRAY_SIZE.height - 1) being the bottom-right pixel in the
     * active pixel array.</p>
     * <p>For devices supporting ACAMERA_DISTORTION_CORRECTION_MODE control, the coordinate
     * system depends on the mode being set.
     * When the distortion correction mode is OFF, the coordinate system follows
     * ACAMERA_SENSOR_INFO_PRE_CORRECTION_ACTIVE_ARRAY_SIZE, with
     * <code>(0, 0)</code> being the top-left pixel of the pre-correction active array, and
     * (ACAMERA_SENSOR_INFO_PRE_CORRECTION_ACTIVE_ARRAY_SIZE.width - 1,
     * ACAMERA_SENSOR_INFO_PRE_CORRECTION_ACTIVE_ARRAY_SIZE.height - 1) being the bottom-right
     * pixel in the pre-correction active pixel array.
     * When the distortion correction mode is not OFF, the coordinate system follows
     * ACAMERA_SENSOR_INFO_ACTIVE_ARRAY_SIZE, with
     * <code>(0, 0)</code> being the top-left pixel of the active array, and
     * (ACAMERA_SENSOR_INFO_ACTIVE_ARRAY_SIZE.width - 1,
     * ACAMERA_SENSOR_INFO_ACTIVE_ARRAY_SIZE.height - 1) being the bottom-right pixel in the
     * active pixel array.</p>
     * <p>The weight must range from 0 to 1000, and represents a weight
     * for every pixel in the area. This means that a large metering area
     * with the same weight as a smaller area will have more effect in
     * the metering result. Metering areas can partially overlap and the
     * camera device will add the weights in the overlap region.</p>
     * <p>The weights are relative to weights of other white balance metering regions, so if
     * only one region is used, all non-zero weights will have the same effect. A region with
     * 0 weight is ignored.</p>
     * <p>If all regions have 0 weight, then no specific metering area needs to be used by the
     * camera device.</p>
     * <p>If the metering region is outside the used ACAMERA_SCALER_CROP_REGION returned in
     * capture result metadata, the camera device will ignore the sections outside the crop
     * region and output only the intersection rectangle as the metering region in the result
     * metadata.  If the region is entirely outside the crop region, it will be ignored and
     * not reported in the result metadata.</p>
     * <p>Starting from API level 30, the coordinate system of activeArraySize or
     * preCorrectionActiveArraySize is used to represent post-zoomRatio field of view, not
     * pre-zoom field of view. This means that the same awbRegions values at different
     * ACAMERA_CONTROL_ZOOM_RATIO represent different parts of the scene. The awbRegions
     * coordinates are relative to the activeArray/preCorrectionActiveArray representing the
     * zoomed field of view. If ACAMERA_CONTROL_ZOOM_RATIO is set to 1.0 (default), the same
     * awbRegions at different ACAMERA_SCALER_CROP_REGION still represent the same parts of
     * the scene as they do before. See ACAMERA_CONTROL_ZOOM_RATIO for details. Whether to use
     * activeArraySize or preCorrectionActiveArraySize still depends on distortion correction
     * mode.</p>
     * <p>The data representation is <code>int[5 * area_count]</code>.

     * <p>Instead of using ACAMERA_SCALER_CROP_REGION with dual purposes of crop and zoom, the
     * application can now choose to use this tag to specify the desired zoom level. The
     * ACAMERA_SCALER_CROP_REGION can still be used to specify the horizontal or vertical
     * crop to achieve aspect ratios different than the native camera sensor.</p>
     * <p>By using this control, the application gains a simpler way to control zoom, which can
     * be a combination of optical and digital zoom. For example, a multi-camera system may
     * contain more than one lens with different focal lengths, and the user can use optical
     * zoom by switching between lenses. Using zoomRatio has benefits in the scenarios below:
     * <em> Zooming in from a wide-angle lens to a telephoto lens: A floating-point ratio provides
     *   better precision compared to an integer value of ACAMERA_SCALER_CROP_REGION.
     * </em> Zooming out from a wide lens to an ultrawide lens: zoomRatio supports zoom-out whereas
     *   ACAMERA_SCALER_CROP_REGION doesn't.</p>
     * <p>To illustrate, here are several scenarios of different zoom ratios, crop regions,
     * and output streams, for a hypothetical camera device with an active array of size
     * <code>(2000,1500)</code>.</p>
     * <ul>

     * <li>Output stream #2: <code>1280x720</code> (720p, 16:9 aspect ratio)</li>
     * </ul>
     * </li>

     * <li>Crop region: <code>Rect(0, 0, 2000, 1500) // (left, top, right, bottom)</code> (post zoom)</li>
     * </ul>

     * <li><img alt="4:3 aspect ratio crop diagram" src="../images/camera2/metadata/android.control.zoomRatio/zoom-ratio-2-crop-43.png" /><ul>

     * </ul>

     * </ul>
     * </li>
     * <li>Case #3: 1:1 crop region with 0.5x zoom out to ultrawide lens.<ul>
     * <li>Zoomed field of view: 4x of original field of view (switched from wide lens to ultrawide lens)</li>
     * <li>Crop region: <code>Rect(250, 0, 1750, 1500)</code></li>

     * </ul>
     * </li>
     * </ul>
     * <p>As seen from the graphs above, the coordinate system of cropRegion now changes to the
     * effective after-zoom field-of-view, and is represented by the rectangle of (0, 0,
     * activeArrayWith, activeArrayHeight). The same applies to AE/AWB/AF regions, and faces.
     * This coordinate system change isn't applicable to RAW capture and its related
     * metadata such as intrinsicCalibration and lensShadingMap.</p>
     * <p>Using the same hypothetical example above, and assuming output stream #1 (640x480) is
     * the viewfinder stream, the application can achieve 2.0x zoom in one of two ways:</p>
     * <ul>
     * <li>zoomRatio = 2.0, scaler.cropRegion = (0, 0, 2000, 1500)</li>
     * <li>zoomRatio = 1.0 (default), scaler.cropRegion = (500, 375, 1500, 1125)</li>
     * </ul>
     * <p>If the application intends to set aeRegions to be top-left quarter of the viewfinder
     * field-of-view, the ACAMERA_CONTROL_AE_REGIONS should be set to (0, 0, 1000, 750) with
     * zoomRatio set to 2.0. Alternatively, the application can set aeRegions to the equivalent
     * region of (500, 375, 1000, 750) for zoomRatio of 1.0. If the application doesn't
     * explicitly set ACAMERA_CONTROL_ZOOM_RATIO, its value defaults to 1.0.</p>
     * <p>One limitation of controlling zoom using zoomRatio is that the ACAMERA_SCALER_CROP_REGION
     * must only be used for letterboxing or pillarboxing of the sensor active array, and no
     * FREEFORM cropping can be used with ACAMERA_CONTROL_ZOOM_RATIO other than 1.0.</p>

     * Control over session parameters can still be exerted in capture requests
     * but clients should be aware and expect delays during their application.

     * <ul>
     * <li>The camera client starts by quering the session parameter key list via
     *   {@link ACameraManager_getCameraCharacteristics }.</li>

     *   using an appropriate template matching the particular use case.</li>
     * <li>The client should go over the list of session parameters and check

     * <li>If there is no such match, the capture request can be  passed
     *   unmodified to

     * <li>If matches do exist, the client should update the respective values
     *   and pass the request to

     * <li>After the capture session initialization completes the session parameter
     *   key list can continue to serve as reference when posting or updating
     *   further requests. As mentioned above further changes to session
     *   parameters should ideally be avoided, if updates are necessary

     * <p>For devices not supporting ACAMERA_DISTORTION_CORRECTION_MODE control, the coordinate
     * system always follows that of ACAMERA_SENSOR_INFO_ACTIVE_ARRAY_SIZE, with <code>(0, 0)</code> being
     * the top-left pixel of the active array.</p>
     * <p>For devices supporting ACAMERA_DISTORTION_CORRECTION_MODE control, the coordinate system
     * depends on the mode being set.  When the distortion correction mode is OFF, the
     * coordinate system follows ACAMERA_SENSOR_INFO_PRE_CORRECTION_ACTIVE_ARRAY_SIZE, with <code>(0,
     * 0)</code> being the top-left pixel of the pre-correction active array.  When the distortion
     * correction mode is not OFF, the coordinate system follows
     * ACAMERA_SENSOR_INFO_ACTIVE_ARRAY_SIZE, with <code>(0, 0)</code> being the top-left pixel of the
     * active array.</p>
     * <p>Output streams use this rectangle to produce their output, cropping to a smaller region
     * if necessary to maintain the stream's aspect ratio, then scaling the sensor input to
     * match the output's configured resolution.</p>
     * <p>The crop region is applied after the RAW to other color space (e.g. YUV)
     * conversion. Since raw streams (e.g. RAW16) don't have the conversion stage, they are not
     * croppable. The crop region will be ignored by raw streams.</p>
     * <p>For non-raw streams, any additional per-stream cropping will be done to maximize the
     * final pixel area of the stream.</p>
     * <p>For example, if the crop region is set to a 4:3 aspect ratio, then 4:3 streams will use
     * the exact crop region. 16:9 streams will further crop vertically (letterbox).</p>
     * <p>Conversely, if the crop region is set to a 16:9, then 4:3 outputs will crop horizontally
     * (pillarbox), and 16:9 streams will match exactly. These additional crops will be
     * centered within the crop region.</p>
     * <p>To illustrate, here are several scenarios of different crop regions and output streams,
     * for a hypothetical camera device with an active array of size <code>(2000,1500)</code>.  Note that
     * several of these examples use non-centered crop regions for ease of illustration; such
     * regions are only supported on devices with FREEFORM capability
     * (ACAMERA_SCALER_CROPPING_TYPE <code>== FREEFORM</code>), but this does not affect the way the crop

     * <p>A stall duration is how much extra time would get added
     * to the normal minimum frame duration for a repeating request
     * that has streams with non-zero stall.</p>
     * <p>For example, consider JPEG captures which have the following
     * characteristics:</p>
     * <ul>
     * <li>JPEG streams act like processed YUV streams in requests for which
     * they are not included; in requests in which they are directly
     * referenced, they act as JPEG streams. This is because supporting a
     * JPEG stream requires the underlying YUV data to always be ready for
     * use by a JPEG encoder, but the encoder will only be used (and impact
     * frame duration) on requests that actually reference a JPEG stream.</li>
     * <li>The JPEG processor can run concurrently to the rest of the camera
     * pipeline, but cannot process more than 1 capture at a time.</li>
     * </ul>
     * <p>In other words, using a repeating YUV request would result
     * in a steady frame rate (let's say it's 30 FPS). If a single
     * JPEG request is submitted periodically, the frame rate will stay
     * at 30 FPS (as long as we wait for the previous JPEG to return each
     * time). If we try to submit a repeating YUV + JPEG request, then
     * the frame rate will drop from 30 FPS.</p>
     * <p>In general, submitting a new request with a non-0 stall time
     * stream will <em>not</em> cause a frame rate drop unless there are still
     * outstanding buffers for that stream from previous requests.</p>
     * <p>Submitting a repeating request with streams (call this <code>S</code>)
     * is the same as setting the minimum frame duration from
     * the normal minimum frame duration corresponding to <code>S</code>, added with
     * the maximum stall duration for <code>S</code>.</p>
     * <p>If interleaving requests with and without a stall duration,
     * a request will stall by the maximum of the remaining times
     * for each can-stall stream with outstanding buffers.</p>
     * <p>This means that a stalling request will not have an exposure start
     * until the stall has completed.</p>
     * <p>This should correspond to the stall duration when only that stream is
     * active, with all processing (typically in android.*.mode) set to FAST
     * or OFF. Setting any of the processing modes to HIGH_QUALITY
     * effectively results in an indeterminate stall duration for all
     * streams in a request (the regular stall calculation rules are
     * ignored).</p>
     * <p>The following formats may always have a stall duration:</p>
     * <ul>
     * <li>{@link AIMAGE_FORMAT_JPEG }</li>
     * <li>{@link AIMAGE_FORMAT_RAW16 }</li>

     * <p>The maximum frame rate that can be supported by a camera subsystem is

     * <li>Requested resolutions of output image streams</li>
     * <li>Availability of binning / skipping modes on the imager</li>
     * <li>The bandwidth of the imager interface</li>

     * sensors, the camera abstraction tries to represent the bandwidth
     * restrictions with as simple a model as possible.</p>
     * <p>The model presented has the following characteristics:</p>
     * <ul>
     * <li>The image sensor is always configured to output the smallest
     * resolution possible given the application's requested output stream
     * sizes.  The smallest resolution is defined as being at least as large
     * as the largest requested output stream size; the camera pipeline must
     * never digitally upsample sensor data when the crop region covers the
     * whole sensor. In general, this means that if only small output stream
     * resolutions are configured, the sensor can provide a higher frame
     * rate.</li>
     * <li>Since any request may use any or all the currently configured
     * output streams, the sensor and ISP must be configured to support
     * scaling a single capture to all the streams at the same time.  This
     * means the camera pipeline must be ready to produce the largest
     * requested output size without any delay.  Therefore, the overall
     * frame rate of a given configured stream set is governed only by the
     * largest requested stream resolution.</li>
     * <li>Using more than one output stream in a request does not affect the
     * frame duration.</li>
     * <li>Certain format-streams may need to do additional background processing
     * before data is consumed/produced by that stream. These processors
     * can run concurrently to the rest of the camera pipeline, but
     * cannot process more than 1 capture at a time.</li>
     * </ul>
     * <p>The necessary information for the application, given the model above, is provided via
     * {@link ACAMERA_SCALER_AVAILABLE_MIN_FRAME_DURATIONS }.
     * These are used to determine the maximum frame rate / minimum frame duration that is
     * possible for a given stream configuration.</p>
     * <p>Specifically, the application can use the following rules to
     * determine the minimum frame duration it can request from the camera
     * device:</p>
     * <ol>
     * <li>Let the set of currently configured input/output streams be called <code>S</code>.</li>
     * <li>Find the minimum frame durations for each stream in <code>S</code>, by looking it up in {@link ACAMERA_SCALER_AVAILABLE_MIN_FRAME_DURATIONS }
     * (with its respective size/format). Let this set of frame durations be called <code>F</code>.</li>
     * <li>For any given request <code>R</code>, the minimum frame duration allowed for <code>R</code> is the maximum
     * out of all values in <code>F</code>. Let the streams used in <code>R</code> be called <code>S_r</code>.</li>
     * </ol>
     * <p>If none of the streams in <code>S_r</code> have a stall time (listed in {@link ACAMERA_SCALER_AVAILABLE_STALL_DURATIONS }
     * using its respective size/format), then the frame duration in <code>F</code> determines the steady
     * state frame rate that the application will get if it uses <code>R</code> as a repeating request. Let
     * this special kind of request be called <code>Rsimple</code>.</p>
     * <p>A repeating request <code>Rsimple</code> can be <em>occasionally</em> interleaved by a single capture of a
     * new request <code>Rstall</code> (which has at least one in-use stream with a non-0 stall time) and if
     * <code>Rstall</code> has the same minimum frame duration this will not cause a frame rate loss if all
     * buffers from the previous <code>Rstall</code> have already been delivered.</p>

     * <li>Choose a pixel (x', y') within the active array region of the raw buffer given in
     * ACAMERA_SENSOR_INFO_PRE_CORRECTION_ACTIVE_ARRAY_SIZE, otherwise this pixel is considered
     * to be outside of the FOV, and will not be shown in the processed output image.</li>
     * <li>Apply geometric distortion correction to get the post-distortion pixel coordinate,
     * (x_i, y_i). When applying geometric correction metadata, note that metadata for raw
     * buffers is defined relative to the top, left of the

     * <li>If the resulting corrected pixel coordinate is within the region given in

     * when the top, left coordinate of that buffer is treated as (0, 0).</li>

     * correction doesn't change the pixel coordinate, the resulting pixel selected in
     * pixel coordinates would be x,y = (25, 25) relative to the top,left of the raw buffer
     * with dimensions given in ACAMERA_SENSOR_INFO_PIXEL_ARRAY_SIZE, and would be (5, 5)
     * relative to the top,left of post-processed YUV output buffer with dimensions given in

     * <p>If the camera device doesn't support geometric distortion correction, or all of the

     * it may start streaming control changes that span over several frame
     * boundaries.</p>
     * <p>In the latter case, whenever a request's settings change relative to

     * have been read back by the camera device, this value will be set
     * to a non-negative frame number (corresponding to the request to
     * which the results have synchronized to).</p>
     * <p>Older camera device implementations may not have a way to detect
     * when all camera controls have been applied, and will always set this
     * value to UNKNOWN.</p>
     * <p>FULL capability devices will always have this value set to the

     * device, for more details see pipeline considerations below).</li>
     * <li>Submitting a series of multiple requests that differ from the
     * previous request (e.g. r1, r2, r3 s.t. r1 != r2 != r3)
     * moves the new synchronization frame to the last non-repeating
     * request (using the smallest frame number from the contiguous list of
     * repeating requests).</li>
     * <li>Submitting the same request repeatedly will not change this value
     * to CONVERGING, if it was already a non-negative value.</li>
     * <li>When this value changes to non-negative, that means that all of the
     * metadata controls from the request have been applied, all of the
     * metadata controls from the camera device have been read to the
     * updated values (into the result), and all of the graphics buffers

     * <p>Therefore, HDR captures operate at a much slower rate

     * <p>In this mode, on LIMITED or FULL devices, when a request

     * of images internally and combining them into one, or it
     * may involve the device using specialized high dynamic
     * range capture hardware. In all cases, a single image is
     * produced in response to a capture request submitted
     * while in HDR mode.</p>
     * <p>Since substantial post-processing is generally needed to
     * produce an HDR image, only YUV, PRIVATE, and JPEG
     * outputs are supported for LIMITED/FULL device HDR
     * captures, and only JPEG outputs are supported for LEGACY
     * HDR captures. Using a RAW output for HDR capture is not

     * configuration where the normal lens is the default, when the logical camera's crop
     * region is set to maximum, the FOV of the logical streams will be that of the normal
     * lens. The FOV of the physical streams for the wide lens will be the same as the

     * compensate for the smaller focal length.</p>
     * <p>Even if the underlying physical cameras have different RAW characteristics (such as
     * size or CFA pattern), a logical camera can still advertise RAW capability. In this

     * the active physical camera will remain active to ensure consistent RAW output
     * behavior, and not switch to other physical cameras.</p>
     * <p>The capture request and result metadata tags required for backward compatible camera
     * functionalities will be solely based on the logical camera capabiltity. On the other
     * hand, the use of manual capture controls (sensor or post-processing) with a
     * logical camera may result in unexpected behavior when the HAL decides to switch
     * between physical cameras with different characteristics under the hood. For example,
     * when the application manually sets exposure time and sensitivity while zooming in,
     * the brightness of the camera images may suddenly change because HAL switches from one
     * physical camera to the other.</p>
