 * Discard all captures currently pending and in-progress as fast as possible.
 *
 * <p>The camera device will discard all of its current work as fast as possible. Some in-flight
 * captures may complete successfully and call
 * {@link ACameraCaptureSession_captureCallbacks#onCaptureCompleted},
 * while others will trigger their {@link ACameraCaptureSession_captureCallbacks#onCaptureFailed}
 * callbacks. If a repeating request list is set, it will be cleared.</p>
 *
 * <p>This method is the fastest way to switch the camera device to a new session with
 * {@link ACameraDevice_createCaptureSession}, at the cost of discarding in-progress
 * work. It must be called before the new session is created. Once all pending requests are
 * either completed or thrown away, the {@link ACameraCaptureSession_stateCallbacks#onReady}
 * callback will be called, if the session has not been closed. Otherwise, the
 * {@link ACameraCaptureSession_stateCallbacks#onClosed}
 * callback will be fired when a new session is created by the camera device and the previous
 * session is being removed from memory.</p>
 *
 * <p>Cancelling will introduce at least a brief pause in the stream of data from the camera
 * device, since once the camera device is emptied, the first new request has to make it through
 * the entire camera pipeline before new output buffers are produced.</p>
 *
 * <p>This means that using ACameraCaptureSession_abortCaptures to simply remove pending requests is
 * not recommended; it's best used for quickly switching output configurations, or for cancelling
 * long in-progress requests (such as a multi-second capture).</p>
