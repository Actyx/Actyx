/**
 * @defgroup AHardwareBuffer Native Hardware Buffer
 *
 * AHardwareBuffer objects represent chunks of memory that can be
 * accessed by various hardware components in the system. It can be
 * easily converted to the Java counterpart
 * android.hardware.HardwareBuffer and passed between processes using
 * Binder. All operations involving AHardwareBuffer and HardwareBuffer
 * are zero-copy, i.e., passing AHardwareBuffer to another process
 * creates a shared view of the same region of memory.
 *
 * AHardwareBuffers can be bound to EGL/OpenGL and Vulkan primitives.
 * For EGL, use the extension function eglGetNativeClientBufferANDROID
 * to obtain an EGLClientBuffer and pass it directly to
 * eglCreateImageKHR. Refer to the EGL extensions
 * EGL_ANDROID_get_native_client_buffer and
 * EGL_ANDROID_image_native_buffer for more information. In Vulkan,
 * the contents of the AHardwareBuffer can be accessed as external
 * memory. See the VK_ANDROID_external_memory_android_hardware_buffer
 * extension for details.
