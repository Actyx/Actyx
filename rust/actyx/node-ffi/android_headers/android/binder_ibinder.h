/**
 * Represents a local or remote object which can be used for IPC or which can itself be sent.
 *
 * This object has a refcount associated with it and will be deleted when its refcount reaches zero.
 * How methods interactive with this refcount is described below. When using this API, it is
 * intended for a client of a service to hold a strong reference to that service. This also means
 * that user data typically should hold a strong reference to a local AIBinder object. A remote
 * AIBinder object automatically holds a strong reference to the AIBinder object in the server's
 * process. A typically memory layout looks like this:
 *
 * Key:
 *   --->         Ownership/a strong reference
 *   ...>         A weak reference
 *
 *                         (process boundary)
 *                                 |
 * MyInterface ---> AIBinder_Weak  |  ProxyForMyInterface
 *      ^                .         |          |
 *      |                .         |          |
 *      |                v         |          v
 *   UserData  <---   AIBinder   <-|-      AIBinder
 *                                 |
 *
 * In this way, you'll notice that a proxy for the interface holds a strong reference to the
 * implementation and that in the server process, the AIBinder object which was sent can be resent
 * so that the same AIBinder object always represents the same object. This allows, for instance, an
 * implementation (usually a callback) to transfer all ownership to a remote process and
 * automatically be deleted when the remote process is done with it or dies. Other memory models are
 * possible, but this is the standard one.
 *
 * If the process containing an AIBinder dies, it is possible to be holding a strong reference to
 * an object which does not exist. In this case, transactions to this binder will return
 * STATUS_DEAD_OBJECT. See also AIBinder_linkToDeath, AIBinder_unlinkToDeath, and AIBinder_isAlive.
 *
 * Once an AIBinder is created, anywhere it is passed (remotely or locally), there is a 1-1
 * correspondence between the address of an AIBinder and the object it represents. This means that
 * when two AIBinder pointers point to the same address, they represent the same object (whether
 * that object is local or remote). This correspondance can be broken accidentally if AIBinder_new
 * is erronesouly called to create the same object multiple times.
