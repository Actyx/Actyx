//! Generic streaming request/response protocol.
//!
//! ## General Usage
//!
//! [`StreamingResponse`] is a `NetworkBehaviour` that implements a generic
//! request/response protocol or protocol family, whereby each request is sent
//! over a new substream on a connection. `StreamingResponse` is generic over the
//! actual messages being sent, which are defined in terms of a [`Codec`].
//! Creating a request/response protocol thus amounts to providing an
//! implementation of this trait which can then be given to
//! [`StreamingResponseConfig::new`], and finally to [`StreamingResponse::new`].
//! Further configuration options are available said config. For convenience, a
//! default implementation for [`StreamingResponse`] is provided.
//!
//! Requests are sent using [`StreamingResponse::request`] and the
//! responses received as [`StreamingResponseEvent::ResponseReceived`].
//!
//! Individual responses are sent using [`StreamingResponse::respond`]
//! upon receiving a [`StreamingResponseEvent::Request`]. The response stream can
//! be finalized by calling [`StreamingResponse::finish_response`],
//! which will result in the emission of an
//! [`StreamingResponseEvent::ResponseFinished`] on the requester's side. After
//! that, the response channel can't be used anymore.
//!
//! An ongoing request is cancelled if either the peer disconnects, or a
//! [`StreamingResponseMessage::CancelRequest`] message is sent.
//!
//! ## Protocol Families
//!
//! A single [`StreamingResponse`] instance can be used with an entire
//! protocol family that share the same request and response types. For that
//! purpose, [`Codec`] is typically instantiated with a sum type.
//!
//! ## Differences to `libp2p::request_response`
//!
//! The ergonomics of this behaviour are inspired by the
//! `libp2p::request_response` implementation. However, it enables the exchange
//! of multiple response frames per request. Currently, it does neither support
//! timeouts nor signalling of successful commits of outbound messages to the
//! underlying transport mechanism. Sending requests and/or responses is a
//! fire-and-forget action. Only if the remote peer is disconnected, consumer
//! code will be notified through [`CancellationReason::PeerDisconnected`] via
//! [`StreamingResponseEvent::ResponseFinished`].
//! Another notable difference is that this behaviour won't initiate any dialing
//! attempts, thus this behaviour needs to be wrapped inside another behaviour
//! providing dialing functionality.
//!
//! ## Parallelism and response frame ordering
//!
//! Internally, this behaviour uses `libp2p::swarm::OneShotHandler`, where for
//! each request a new substream is created. Meaning, that for each request and
//! all subsequent responses, this substream is used. Given the asynchronous
//! nature of the internals of `libp2p`, smaller response frames might make it to
//! the recipient earlier than bigger ones. Each response frame includes a
//! monotonic sequence number, which can be used for ordering purposes. However,
//! users can also set [`StreamingResponseConfig::ordered_outgoing`] flag, which
//! will commit individual responses sequentially to the underlying transport
//! mechanism.
